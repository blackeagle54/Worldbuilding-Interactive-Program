# Decision Log

## 2026-01-30: Project Creation
- Created GitHub repo: `blackeagle54/Worldbuilding-Interactive-Program`
- Cloned to `C:\Worldbuilding-Interactive-Program`

## 2026-01-30: Source Material
- Using "The Complete Art of World Building" by Randy Ellefson as the foundation
- Book has 3 volumes, 30 chapters total
- Full text extracted to `source-text.txt` (8,677 paragraphs)

## 2026-01-30: Analysis Approach
- Each volume analyzed by an Opus-level agent in parallel
- Each chapter broken into: core concept, topics, key discussions, concepts, templates, dependencies, milestones
- Goal: chunk every element into stepping stones that must be progressed in order

## 2026-01-30: Agent Policy
- Use Opus-level agents for all research and complex tasks (user preference)

## 2026-01-30: Memory System
- Set up CLAUDE.md with project rules and file references
- Created docs/decisions.md (this file) and docs/progress.md for persistent context
- Set up .claude/rules/ directory for scoped instructions
- Researched MCP memory servers, hook-based systems, and file-based strategies
