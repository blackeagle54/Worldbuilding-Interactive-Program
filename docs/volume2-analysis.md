# Volume 2: Creating Places -- Complete Chapter Analysis

---

## Chapter 1: Case Studies

### Core Concept
Demonstrates through three real-world examples from the author's setting (Llurien) how geographic decisions about land features, straits, mountains, and positioning naturally lead to political alliances, enemies, trade routes, and sovereign power types. The chapter shows the practical payoff of the material in the rest of the volume.

### Topics
- Case Study 1: Two Straits and a Sea of Enemies (how two narrow straits control access to a sea and shape the relationships of six sovereign powers)
- The Sea of Fire and its straits (Strait of Erizon, Strait of Niora)
- The equator's role in wind direction, forest types, and skin color
- Erizon: wizard-centric oligarchy and naval power
- Kysh: constitutional monarchy / empire controlling the difficult strait
- Niora: island kingdom between two straits, repeatedly conquered
- Rone: kingdom opposing imperial expansion
- Marula: absolute monarchy in a hot desert caused by rain shadow, with cultural worship of the sun
- Pell: federal republic caught between hostile neighbors
- Naming considerations for geographic features
- Case Study 2: Stopping an Empire's Expansion (how one power's geography earns enemies and allies, and how alliances form to stop imperial conquest)
- Case Study 3: Mountains and Murder (impact of mountain ranges on terrain, deserts, grasslands, trade routes, and sovereign power relationships)
- Winds and rain shadows creating deserts, grasslands
- Nomadic horse tribes caught between warring powers
- Mountain passes as contested trade routes with castles at each end

### Key Discussions
- Geography drives politics: the shape of coastlines, placement of straits, and mountain positions naturally suggest which powers are allies or enemies
- Government type creates ideological opposition that fuels conflict
- Rain shadows from mountain ranges determine vegetation, which determines resources, which determines economic relationships
- Naming features based on their characteristics or events (Sea of Fire named for equatorial heat and frequent ship battles)
- The equator's position relative to land masses affects everything from forest types to skin color to wind patterns
- Multiple sovereign powers with different government philosophies create natural tension

### Concepts to Internalize
- Geography is the foundation of political relationships in worldbuilding
- Every geographic feature (strait, mountain range, desert) creates consequences for the societies around it
- Government types should vary across sovereign powers to create ideological friction
- Rain shadows from mountains are one of the most important geographic concepts for placing deserts and forests
- Naming conventions should reflect the character of a place
- Continental positioning relative to the equator has cascading effects on all aspects of life

### Template Suggestions

## Chapter 2: Creating a Planet

### Core Concept
Covers the global-scale decisions a worldbuilder must make about their planet, including its sun, moons, rotation, tides, seasons, climate zones, prevailing winds, rain shadows, and constellations. These planetary-level decisions cascade down to affect every continent, settlement, and story on the world.

### Topics
- Rotation direction and its effect on sunrise/sunset, ocean currents, and prevailing winds
- The sun's impact (yellow dwarf vs. red dwarf; tidal locking; habitable zones)
- Moon(s) impact on tides, seasons, day length, and moonlight
- Tidal locking (satellite to planet, mutual tidal locking)
- Tides (spring tides, neap tides, effect of multiple moons, the formula for conjunction cycles)
- Moon orbit calculator and conjunction formula: (P1 * P2) / (P2 - P1) = C
- Seasons and axial tilt (23.5 degrees as the Goldilocks tilt)
- Hours in the day (moon's effect on planetary spin rate)
- Moonlight (reflectivity based on moon surface composition)
- Other planets in the solar system (rocky vs. gas giants, habitable zone limits)
- Stars above (naming bright stars, significance)
- Constellations (creation, placement near equator vs. poles, association with gods, seasonal visibility)
- Dark constellations (interstellar gas clouds)
- Passing asteroids and comets
- Understanding climates: the equator's role, the ocean's role (currents, warm/cold coasts)
- Climate zones: tropics, subtropics, temperate, polar
- Prevailing winds (trade winds, westerlies, polar winds)
- Rain shadows (how mountains block moisture and create deserts)
- Detailed climate types using Koppen classification: tropical rainforest, tropical monsoon, tropical wet/dry (savannah), dry (hot/cold/mild desert), temperate (dry summer/Mediterranean, warm temperate, maritime/oceanic, highland tropical, subarctic/subpolar, subalpine), humid continental (hot summer, warm summer, subarctic, extremely severe winter), polar (tundra, ice cap)
- Climate chart summary
- Where to start

### Key Discussions
- The tradeoff between scientific accuracy and creative freedom (physicists vs. general audience)
- Why having at least one moon is strongly recommended (stabilizes tilt, seasons, day length)
- Multiple moons create complex tidal patterns that affect sailors, port towns, and water-dwelling species
- The formula for calculating when two moons align and how this can be tied to calendar/cultural events
- Ocean currents cause warm eastern coasts and cold western coasts (on an Earth-rotating planet), affecting where species and creatures are found
- Rain shadows are perhaps the single most important concept for placing forests and deserts
- Climate zones are rough guidelines, not exact boundaries -- worldbuilders have creative license
- Constellations can be tools for characterizing gods (good gods = light constellations, evil gods = dark constellations)
- Space port placement near the equator for fuel efficiency (SF consideration)

### Concepts to Internalize
- Planetary rotation direction affects wind, currents, sunrise/sunset direction
- Moons stabilize axial tilt, cause tides, slow planetary rotation, and provide moonlight
- The conjunction formula for multiple moons: (P1 * P2) / (P2 - P1) = C
- Prevailing winds blow east in the tropics, west in temperate zones, east (lightly) in polar zones
- Rain shadows: mountains block moisture-carrying winds, causing lush vegetation on the windward side and desert on the leeward side
- Climate is determined by latitude, altitude, proximity to water, and rain shadows
- Koppen climate classification provides the vocabulary for describing climates
- Constellations near the equator are visible from both hemispheres; those near poles are not

### Template Suggestions

## Chapter 3: Creating a Continent

### Core Concept
Provides the framework for designing a continent, from its overall shape and position relative to the equator, to understanding plate tectonics, seas, bays, islands, and the process of carving up land into sovereign powers. Emphasizes that even areas not used in detail should have basic thought given to them.

### Topics
- Why we usually build less than a full world in detail
- Multiple continents (naming, reputation, basic sovereign powers even for unused continents)
- Questions to ask about other continents (naval superpowers, slave trade, rainforests, exotic animals, spice trade)
- Which hemisphere the continent is in (effects on climate, moons appearing upside down, reversed moon phases, season reversal)
- Seasonal issues and calendar implications of hemisphere choice
- Plate tectonics: convergent, divergent, and transform boundaries
  - Ocean-to-continent convergence (coastal mountain ranges with explosive volcanoes)
  - Ocean-to-ocean convergence (volcanic island arcs, deep ocean trenches)
  - Continent-to-continent convergence (tallest mountains, no volcanoes, interior location)
  - Divergent boundaries (volcanic islands, seas forming from land splitting)
  - Transform boundaries (earthquakes, no mountains)
- Continental shelves (deep water near coast = mountains and sea monsters nearby)
- Seas vs. oceans (naming conventions, reputation-based naming, Bermuda Triangle-style myths)
- Bays, gulfs, coves, fjords, inlets, sounds, straits, channels, passages
- Islands (continental vs. oceanic/volcanic, naming chains and regions)
- Where to start creating a continent

### Key Discussions
- Even unused continents benefit from having names, basic sovereign powers, and reputations
- Hemisphere choice determines whether cold is north or south, and reverses seasons
- Plate tectonics explains where mountains, volcanoes, earthquakes, deep ocean trenches, and volcanic islands form
- Deep water near a coast implies nearby mountains and potential sea monster habitats
- The distinction between seas, oceans, bays, and lakes is often arbitrary and naming can be based on reputation or perception
- Bays lessen wind and wave effects, making them natural sites for settlements
- Continental islands have shallow seas (no deep-water monsters) vs. oceanic islands which are volcanic

### Concepts to Internalize
- Position relative to the equator determines climate, wind direction, and vegetation
- Three types of plate boundaries create different geographic features
- Coastal mountain ranges = ocean-to-continent convergence (with volcanoes)
- Interior mountain ranges = continent-to-continent convergence (tallest, no volcanoes)
- Deep water just offshore = plate boundary nearby = mountains and possibly sea monsters
- Bays are natural settlement locations; name water bodies based on reputation or function
- Even basic notes on unused continents add depth to the world

### Template Suggestions
**Continent Profile Template**
- Fields: Continent name; Approximate size (Earth analogue); Hemisphere(s) occupied; Latitude range (distance from equator); Position relative to other continents; Overall shape notes; Number of sovereign powers; List of sovereign powers (name, government type, rough location); Known reputations (naval power, slave trade, exotic goods, etc.); Major water bodies (seas, bays, straits) with names; Major islands; Plate boundary locations; Notes on tectonic activity

**Water Body Reference Sheet**
- Fields: Name; Type (ocean, sea, bay, gulf, cove, fjord, inlet, sound, strait); Location; Reputation/myths; Notable features; Settlements on shores

### Dependencies

- Decision on hemisphere and latitude (equator relationship)
- Understanding of where plate tectonics suggest mountains and volcanoes
- Named water bodies (at least major seas, bays, and straits)
- Basic sovereign power divisions sketched onto the continent
- At least rough notes on any secondary continents

## Chapter 4: Creating Land Features

### Core Concept
A comprehensive guide to the land features that populate a continent -- mountains, volcanoes, rivers, lakes, forests (and their many types), grasslands, wetlands, and deserts -- with emphasis on how to characterize each for storytelling purposes, including what species live there and how each feature affects travel and settlement.

### Topics
- Mountain ranges
  - Height significance (3-4000 ft vs. 10,000+ ft; rain shadow impact; oxygen deprivation above 8000 ft)
  - Olympus Mons vs. dramatic solitary peaks
  - Multiple ranges (regional names within a larger range)
  - Volcanoes (active, dormant, extinct; volcanic winter; continuous eruption as narrative device)
  - Characterizing mountains: height, residents (species, tunneling species like dwarves, monsters), travel difficulty, settlement safety
  - Example descriptions (Forbidden Peaks, Soaring Peaks)
- Water features
  - Rivers (young/steep/fast vs. mature/slow/wide vs. old/meandering/floodplains; rivers as national boundaries)
  - Lakes (freshwater vs. salt, natural outflows, lakes that vanish, depth for monsters)
  - Ponds vs. lakes
- Forests (800+ definitions!)
  - Forest (60-100% canopy, temperate/boreal/tropical rainforest types)
  - Woodland (less density, lighter, easier to traverse)
  - Savannah (no canopy despite trees, grass-covered, grazing animals)
  - Jungle (dense underbrush, nearly impassable, contrasted with rainforest)
  - Characterizing forests: canopy/underbrush density, tree types (evergreen, coniferous, deciduous), residents, example descriptions (Horn Wood, Dark Wood, Adelia Forest)
- Prairies/Grasslands (tall, short, mixed grass; rain shadows and human/species intervention)
- Wetlands
  - Mires: bogs (peat, acidic, domed, cold temperate, carnivorous plants, undead possibilities) and fens (grasses/shrubs, meadow-like, deceptive, mountain location)
  - Marshes (slow rivers, lake edges, grasses/reeds, shallow water)
  - Swamps (wetland with forest, hammocks of dry land)
- Deserts
  - Rain shadow deserts; equatorial desert possibility with high elevation
  - 80% of deserts are rocky, not sandy
  - Sand dunes vs. packed stone "pavement"
  - Hot, cold, and mild desert types
  - Sandstorms vs. dust storms (sand stays low; dust goes high)
- Settlements placement (by water, historical growth patterns)
- Cultivation (how sentient species alter landscape: deforestation, dams, pollution, etc.)
- Where to start (mountains first, then rain shadows, then vegetation)

### Key Discussions
- Mountain height is critical: low mountains may not cause rain shadows; tall ones absolutely will
- The distinction between forest, woodland, savannah, jungle, and rainforest matters for travel, ambush potential, and species habitats
- Wetlands are underused in worldbuilding but offer rich storytelling opportunities (monsters, herbs, deception)
- Most deserts are rocky, not sandy -- a common misconception that affects scene accuracy
- Rivers are natural national boundaries
- Young rivers are straight and fast; old rivers are winding and slow (drawing implications)
- Cultivation by sentient species should be considered (deforestation, dams, global warming equivalents)
- Mountains should be placed first on a continent because they determine everything else

### Concepts to Internalize
- Mountains first: they determine precipitation, which determines forests, deserts, and rivers
- Forest types have distinct characteristics affecting travel and combat
- Jungles border rainforests (light at edges allows underbrush)
- Wetlands near settlements should be documented even if not drawn on continent maps
- Only 20% of deserts are sand; rest is rocky pavement
- River age determines appearance and character
- Species cultivation of the landscape should be accounted for

### Template Suggestions
**Land Feature Catalog Template**
- Fields per mountain range: Name; Location; Height range (ft/m); Volcanic (yes/no, active/dormant/extinct); Rain shadow direction; Resident species; Known dangers; Tunnels/underground civilizations; Notable passes; Travel difficulty rating; Example description
- Fields per forest: Name; Type (forest/woodland/savannah/jungle/rainforest); Location; Climate zone; Tree types (evergreen/coniferous/deciduous); Canopy density; Underbrush density; Resident species and creatures; Dangerous plants; Nearby settlements; Example description

## Chapter 5: Creating a Sovereign Power

### Core Concept
An extensive guide to creating sovereign powers (kingdoms, empires, republics, etc.), covering the concept of sovereignty, government types from autocracies to democracies to federations, the roles of heads of state and government, how to choose and characterize a government, and practical creation steps including population, world view, language, customs, location, climate, relationships, and identifiers (symbols, flags, slogans, reputation).

### Topics
- Sovereignty (external recognition, internal recognition, exclusivity)
- External sovereignty (recognition by other powers, dependence vs. independence)
- Internal sovereignty (relationship with subjects, overthrow conditions)
- Gaining sovereignty (conquest, treaty, terra nullius, divine right of kings)
- The Divine Right of Kings (polytheistic variants, Asian variant where unjust rulers lose the right)
- Losing sovereignty (conquest, revolution, power vacuum)
- Collective sovereignty (EU-style unions, SF armada alliances)
- Federation vs. confederation vs. unitary state sovereignty
- Roles: Head of State (ceremonial, knighthood, martial law), Head of Government (prime minister, chancellor, powers and limits), Ministers
- Branches of government (executive, judicial, legislative; separation of powers)
- Parliamentary systems (vote of no confidence, prime minister selection methods)
- Government Types organized by power source:
  - Authoritative States: Autocracy, Totalitarian, Authoritarian, Dictatorship
  - Democracies: Direct, Indirect/Representative, Republic, Parliamentary democracy, Presidential democracy; Rights in democracies; Rise and fall of democracy
  - Federations: Federation, Unitary State, Confederation, Empire
  - Monarchies: Constitutional vs. Absolute; Succession (hereditary, primogeniture, elected); Other limits (military)
  - Oligarchies: Aristocracy, Plutocracy, Military Junta, Stratocracy, Timocracy, Magocracy, other invented types
  - Other: Theocracy, Nation (concept vs. government), Country (vague term)
- Creating a sovereign power step by step:
  - Choosing a government
  - History (previous government types, legacies)
  - How many powers to invent
  - Invent for today (present-day focus)
  - Population count and type (inclusion, exclusion, numbers/percentages)
  - World view (ideological drivers)
  - Language (common tongue, working knowledge, universal translators in SF)
  - Customs (expectations, culture clashes)
  - Location (adage "location is everything," landscape influence)
  - Climate impact on inhabitants and culture
  - Relationships (causes of tension: ethnicity, resources, territory, world view, internal conflict)
  - Ways to identify the power: Symbols, Colors, Flags, Slogans, Reputation

### Key Discussions
- A sovereign power's name may not match its actual government type (Empire of Kysh could function as a federation)
- Government types don't last forever; tracking changes creates rich history
- The divine right of kings works differently in polytheistic worlds
- Democracies can fail when the balance of power tips
- Empires absorb multi-ethnic peoples and force cultural consolidation; their collapse is catastrophic
- Population percentage of each species should be decided for each power
- World view should be characterized by a few broad ideas (magic banned, exploration cherished, military might valued, etc.)
- Symbols should convey the desired impression (aggressive vs. inclusive)
- Reputation should be specific (mad king, slave trade, naval superpower, unique products)

### Concepts to Internalize
- Government type is the first and most important decision for a sovereign power
- Head of State vs. Head of Government distinction is critical (ceremonial vs. actual power)
- Every government type has strengths and weaknesses that create storytelling opportunities
- Species population percentages affect government, culture, and inclusion
- Location determines climate, neighbors, and available resources
- Relationships between powers are driven by ethnicity, resources, territory, world view, and internal conflict
- Identifiers (symbols, colors, flags, slogans) embody fundamental traits and should be consistent

### Template Suggestions

## Chapter 6: Creating a Settlement

### Core Concept
A detailed guide to creating settlements of all sizes -- from outposts and castles to villages, towns, cities, and space stations -- covering location, terrain, water supply, population, defense, history, reputation, zoning, products, secrets, and identifiers. The most practical chapter for creating the places characters actually visit.

### Topics
- Determine location (climate, terrain, travel/farming/products, impact on layout)
- Water supply type and location (river, lake, spring, well; seawater unusable)
- Old Town considerations (crowded, narrow streets, possibly rundown or preserved)
- Neighbors: sovereign powers (deep within vs. border; independent settlement vulnerability), other settlements (friends and enemies)
- Regions and land features (nearby dangers affect fortifications and layout)
- Population considerations:
  - Which species are here (percentages, land feature proximity, species integration)
  - Leaders (formal vs. informal, power levels, election vs. appointment)
  - Power structures (mayor, city council, wards)
  - Influencers (clandestine groups, lobbying, benevolent wizards)
  - Important people (heroes, villains, wizards, priests, celebrities, monsters)
  - Population dispositions (dangerous/safe, quirky, boring, sleepy/bustling, transient/stable, etc.)
- Quarters (species-based neighborhoods, French Quarter model)
- Understanding zoning (residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, mixed)
- Settlement types:
  - Outposts (small, possibly seasonal, limited resources)
  - Castles (self-sufficient, strategic placement, changing hands)
  - Villages (reason for existing, no formal protection, limited skills, everyone knows everyone)
  - Towns (competition and backup resources, formal guards, taxes, farming, mayor/council)
  - Cities (formality, diversity, crime, zoning, fortifications, garrisons, pollution, infrastructure)
  - In Space: vacuum settlements (artificial everything), orbiting settlements (tidal locking, real estate values)
- Defense and offense:
  - Fortifications (cleared areas, archery towers, castles, walls)
  - Armed forces (local guards, cavalry, knights, flying forces, navy)
- Determine history (changing hands, conquests, mixed building styles, monuments)
- Local lore (legends, myths, supernatural phenomena)
- How it is known: reputation, colors, symbols, slogans, products
- Secrets (hidden rooms, catacombs, portals, statues with unknown features)
- How many places to create (full details for story locations; spreadsheet for all others)
- Master spreadsheet columns: Name, Sovereign power, Location, Population size, Species percentages, Products, Symbol, Colors, Military
- Where to start (location first, then size/population, then defense)

### Key Discussions
- Settlement location affects everything: climate, dress, neighbors, defense needs
- Water supply is the most fundamental requirement and determines settlement placement
- Old Town areas create natural character for a settlement (crowded, historical, possibly dangerous)
- Species quarters add cultural variety (Elven Quarter with trees like Central Park)
- Zoning evolves over time -- older areas are mixed use, newer areas are separated
- Settlement size determines formality, diversity, crime, and resource quality
- Outposts and castles offer unique storytelling opportunities (abandoned places, seasonal occupation, mystery)
- Defense should be designed around specific threats (what direction do attacks come from?)
- A master spreadsheet prevents duplicate symbols and provides quick reference
- Products create trade relationships, animosities, and story hooks
- Secrets should be saved until needed rather than pre-planned

### Concepts to Internalize
- Always place settlements near water (river, lake, spring, well)
- Settlement size determines everything from formality to crime to species diversity
- Every settlement should have a reason for existing in its location
- Species percentages in settlements should reflect nearby land features
- Defense design should respond to specific threats
- History of conquests leaves architectural, cultural, and psychological marks
- Products, reputation, and identifiers give each settlement a unique character
- A master spreadsheet is essential for worlds with many settlements

### Template Suggestions

## Chapter 7: Travel Over Land

### Core Concept
Provides a systematic method for calculating realistic travel times over land, covering walking, riding, flying, and vehicle travel, with terrain modifiers and a detailed Excel spreadsheet template system. Primarily focused on fantasy-era travel but applicable to all settings.

### Topics
- Mode of travel:
  - Walking (12 miles/day baseline; armor and supplies reduce speed; age/fitness matters; caravans move at slowest speed)
  - Riding on land (light/medium/heavy encumbrance; 30-40 miles/day light; specialized horses 100+ miles/day; Pony Express model)
  - Flying: animals (carrier pigeon 50mph/700 miles per day; hawks 20-40mph; humanoid flyers slower and less maneuverable), airships (30-84mph, altitude limits, refueling), balloons (3-6mph, wind-dependent), airplanes (too varied to summarize)
- Obstacles and terrain impact
  - Roads, forests (light vs. heavy), rolling hills, mountains, sandy deserts, swamps
  - Rivers requiring crossing (fords, bridges, tolls, detours)
  - Life threats (animals, species) slowing travel
- Calculation preparation
  - Getting organized (alphabetized spreadsheet, geographic grouping)
  - Measuring map distances (physical or digital)
  - Terrain breakdown between two points (inches per terrain type)
  - Setting map scale (pick a number; e.g., 0.25 inches = 20 miles)
  - Using Earth analogues for scale reference
- Base Miles Per Day (BMPD)
  - Walking human: 12; Riding horse: 35; Wagon: 18; Carrier pigeon: 700; Dragon: 360
  - Terrain modifiers (percentage reduction): road 0%, light forest 15%, heavy forest 66%, hills 25%, mountains 50%, desert/swamp 33%
  - Horse ideal terrain is plains (not road -- stones hard on feet)
- Calculations
  - Formula: Distance / (BMPD - Terrain Modifier)
  - Pre-set calculation tables (lookup by inches on map)
  - Custom calculations (preserving travel times in a database)
- The Excel template
  - Schema sheet (scale setting, BMPD, terrain modifiers)
  - Travel sheet (start/destination, inches over terrain types, miles over terrain types, days by travel mode)
  - Manual Travel sheet (pre-set lookup tables)
  - Area Sizing sheet (region dimensions in miles/km, square miles with shape adjustment percentage)
- Where to start

### Key Discussions
- "Not drawn to scale" on maps provides creative leeway
- Horses prefer soft ground; roads (cobblestone) actually slow them
- Caravans move at the speed of the slowest member
- Flying creatures struggle with thin air at high altitude (even dragons)
- Political hostility can alter flight paths (outlawed dragons, hostile territory)
- The template system allows scale changes to automatically update all calculations
- Most worldbuilders should use the pre-set calculation tables rather than custom formulas
- Area sizing helps determine how large sovereign powers and land features are

### Concepts to Internalize
- Walking human baseline: 12 miles/day
- Terrain modifiers significantly affect travel time (heavy forest cuts speed by 66%)
- Map scale should be chosen early and can be adjusted via the spreadsheet
- Travel calculations should be preserved in a database for consistency
- "Not drawn to scale" protects against over-scrutiny
- Every terrain type affects different travel modes differently (wagons can't go through forests)

### Template Suggestions
**Land Travel Calculator Template (Excel Spreadsheet)**
- Schema Sheet: Map scale (miles per quarter inch); BMPD for each travel mode; Terrain modifiers (percentage reduction for each terrain type per travel mode)
- Travel Sheet: Start location; Destination; Inches over each terrain type (road, plains, light forest, heavy forest, hills, mountains, desert, swamp); Auto-calculated miles per terrain; Auto-calculated days per travel mode
- Manual Travel Sheet: Pre-set lookup tables by terrain type showing days per travel mode for standard distances
- Area Sizing Sheet: Region name; Length (inches and miles); Height (inches and miles); Shape adjustment percentage; Square miles; Square kilometers

**Travel Distance Reference**
- Fields: Start location; End location; Total distance (miles/km); Terrain breakdown; Travel time by foot; Travel time by horse; Travel time by wagon; Travel time by flying creature; Notes on obstacles or detours

### Dependencies
- Chapter 3 (Creating a Continent) for the map to measure
- Chapter 4 (Creating Land Features) for terrain types between locations
- Chapter 6 (Creating a Settlement) for settlement locations to measure between

### Progression Milestones
- Map scale determined
- Distances measured between at least key settlement pairs
- Terrain types documented between each pair of locations
- BMPD values chosen for relevant travel modes
- At least the pre-set calculation tables used to determine travel times
- Travel reference document started with key routes

## Chapter 8: Travel by Water

### Core Concept
Covers ship-based travel, including sailing terminology, ship types, ship ratings, speeds under sail and oar, travel time calculations for sea journeys, weapons (cannons and alternatives like the ballista), and ship personnel. Provides practical calculation methods for determining how long sea voyages take.

### Topics
- Factors affecting journey difficulty (wind direction, shipbuilding skill, trade routes)
- Reasons for leeway in determining trip duration (not drawn to scale, variable wind, ship type, cargo weight, damage, fictional planet)
- Ship terms: masts (main, fore, mizzen), yards (horizontal vs. lateen/sloped), sails (square-rigged vs. lateen/fore-and-aft)
- Ship rates (British Navy rating system: first-rate 100+ guns/841 men down to sixth-rate 20-28 guns/128-198 men)
- Ship types:
  - Long ships: Galley (oar-powered, maneuverable, coastal), Galleass (large galley with artillery)
  - Round ships: Man-o-war (generic term), Brig (two-masted, fast, pirates), Frigate (fast, independent, scouting, doesn't join line of battle), Fire Ship (any ship rigged to burn), Galleon (lateen mizzen, distinctive beak prow), Gunboat (small, cheap, one or more large guns), Ship-of-the-line (60+ guns, line of battle), Sloop (single mast, not a warship), Corvette/Sloop-of-war (warship, single gun deck), Privateer (privately operated with letter of marque)
- Ship speeds:
  - By oars (2-3 knots with favorable wind, 1-1.5 unfavorable; top speed 8 knots unsustainable)
  - By sails (4-6 knots open ocean, 3-4 knots coastal; max ~11 knots ideal conditions)
  - Calculation steps for travel time: measure distance, convert to nautical miles (divide by 1.151), divide by speed in knots to get hours
  - Coastal vs. open ocean legs; overnight stops (8 hours lost per stop)
  - On rivers (0-6 knots; typically 1-4 knots; faster in narrow channels and at outer bends)
- Weapons:
  - The cannon (36-pounder needs 14 men; 2-3 shots per 5 minutes; gunpowder implications)
  - Alternatives to cannon for worlds without gunpowder: trebuchet (top deck only), catapult (similar issues), ballista (best replacement; straight-line fire; fewer crew; 2-3 shots per minute; can fire chain shot and balls)
  - Ballista advantages: no recoil, faster firing, fewer crew, easier aiming
- Ship personnel:
  - Warriors (knights, ninjas/martial artists for boarding)
  - Close range combat considerations (space constraints)
  - Long range (archery before and after entanglement)
  - Wizards (wind control, navigation, finding enemies, teleportation, battle assistance)
  - Species (climbers in rigging, flyers for scouting, water-dwellers for hull repair and underwater missions)
- Where to start

### Key Discussions
- A knot is one nautical mile per hour; nautical mile = 1.151 land miles
- Ships rarely travel at maximum speed; 4-6 knots is realistic for open ocean
- Coastal sailing involves stops, variable winds, and slower speeds than open ocean
- If a world lacks gunpowder, the ballista is the best cannon replacement (and is actually superior in firing rate)
- Knights on ships make sense in worlds without gunpowder (armor not rendered useless by bullets)
- Pirates wouldn't attack ships known to have knights aboard
- Water-dwelling species could dramatically alter naval warfare
- River speed depends on width, depth, and curvature

### Concepts to Internalize
- Open ocean: 4-6 knots typical; Coastal: 3-4 knots typical
- Nautical mile = 1.151 land miles
- Travel time formula: nautical miles / speed in knots = hours
- Coastal journeys lose ~8 hours per overnight stop
- Ballista fire 2-3 shots/minute vs. cannon 2-3 shots/5 minutes
- Ship types serve different purposes; frigates are the largest independent vessels
- Letters of marque distinguish privateers from pirates

### Template Suggestions
**Sea Travel Calculator Template**
- Fields: Start port; Destination port; Coastal distance (miles/km); Open ocean distance (miles/km); Total nautical miles; Estimated hours at 6 knots; Estimated hours at 4 knots; Estimated hours at 2 knots (oar); Number of overnight stops; Total adjusted hours; Notes on hazards

## Chapter 9: Travel in Space

### Core Concept
Covers space travel considerations for SF worldbuilders, including the realities of space, propulsion systems (STL and FTL), distance calculation challenges, ship structure (external and internal), and why precise travel calculations are less necessary in space than on land or sea.

### Topics
- The realities of space (cold, no oxygen, gravity everywhere, artificial gravity convention)
- Consistency in technological believability (hierarchy of believability: communication > non-living matter transport > living matter transport)
- Propulsion types:
  - Air breathing engines (atmospheric, switching between space and atmosphere engines)
  - Space engines: STL (slower-than-light, rear thrust, time dilation possible)
  - FTL engines:
    - Jump Drive (instant teleportation, eliminates travel conflict -- use sparingly)
    - Hyper Drive (separate dimension, no time dilation, can't communicate with normal space)
    - Warp Drive (public domain despite Star Trek association, multiple velocities, remains in normal space)
- Distance (orbiting bodies change relative position; destination is where target will be, not where it is)
- Travel time (enormous leeway; no calculator needed; fictional technology + fictional distances = no one can prove you wrong)
- Ship structure:
  - External (aerodynamic vs. non-aerodynamic; weaponry location; boarding location; engine location; rotation for gravity)
  - Internal (bridge, living quarters, entertainment, shops, dining, cargo, brig, medical, engines, main/auxiliary power, escape pods, weaponry)
  - Do we need to invent structure? (video games yes; books/TV less critical; consistency matters for recurring ships)
  - What to include (detailed list of ship areas with design considerations)
- Time and distance within ships (transit between locations; ladders vs. stairs; consistency across episodes/books)
- Where to start (atmospheric capability first, then ship type, then boarding/quarters, then propulsion purpose, then story vulnerabilities)

### Key Discussions
- Consistency in technological level is more important than accuracy
- A hierarchy of believability: communication tech is easiest to accept, matter transportation is hardest
- Jump drives eliminate travel conflict and should be severely limited
- FTL engines could theoretically be placed deep inside a ship for protection, while STL engines must be rear-facing
- Aerodynamic ship design makes sense even in space (atmosphere entry capability)
- Ship internal structure should be planned for consistency even if never shown to the audience
- The most important thing about distance in space is that it changes constantly
- No travel calculator is needed for space because all technologies and distances are fictional

### Concepts to Internalize
- Be consistent with technological believability across all aspects of a setting
- STL engines cause time dilation; FTL engines typically do not
- Jump drive should be limited to preserve story conflict
- Ship structure matters most for consistency and story vulnerability
- Destinations in space orbit, so distance between two points changes constantly
- Space travel times need only be plausible, not precise

### Template Suggestions
**Spacecraft Profile Template**
- Fields: Ship name; Ship class/type; Purpose (cargo/war/passenger/exploration); Atmospheric capability (yes/no); Propulsion types (STL, FTL type, atmospheric); Max speed (STL); FTL capability and limits; Crew capacity; Passenger capacity; Cargo capacity; Weaponry (type, location, direction); Boarding locations; Bridge location; Engineering location; Living quarters layout; Entertainment/shops; Medical bay; Brig; Escape pods (number, locations); Power sources (primary, auxiliary, locations); Notable features; Vulnerabilities; Sovereign power affiliation; Home port/station; Notable crew; Key transit times between internal locations

**Space Travel Reference**
- Fields: Origin; Destination; Typical distance range (closest to farthest orbital positions); FTL travel time estimate; STL travel time estimate; Hazards along route; Notable waypoints

### Dependencies
- Chapter 2 (Creating a Planet) for solar system context (other planets, moons)
- Chapter 5 (Creating a Sovereign Power) for spacefaring powers and their fleets
- Chapter 6 (Creating a Settlement) for space stations and orbital settlements

### Progression Milestones
- Propulsion hierarchy decided (which FTL type, what limits)
- At least one key spacecraft designed with internal structure notes
- Decision on whether ships are atmosphere-capable
- Travel time estimates for key routes (even if approximate)
- Consistency rules established for the setting's technology level

## Chapter 10: Creating Time and History

### Core Concept
Covers the creation of time measurement systems (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years) and world history, including sample history entries, creation myths, historical ages, and categories of historical events. Emphasizes that history enriches the present without needing to be exhaustive.

### Topics
- Why create history (adds realism, supports travel stories, ancient civilizations leave relics)
- Architecture of ancient civilizations as scene-setting tool
- Post-apocalypse settings need a cataclysm
- Organizing history (world events in one file, continent/region events in others)
- Sample history entries (demonstrating format: date, title, summary paragraph)
  - Horn of Killian Lost, Orb of Staran Created, War of Beasts, Kingdom Norin Falls, Expedition Disappears
  - Showing how 10 minutes of brainstorming produces world figures, magic items, kingdoms, wars, and creatures
- Cross-filing created items (supernatural items file, kingdoms file, land features file, animals file)
- Creation myths (earliest events in history)
- Measuring time:
  - Minutes and hours (recommend keeping Earth-like; different lengths confuse without payoff)
  - Days in a week (can change; base on celestial bodies, gods, schools of magic, etc.; recommended: 6 or 8 days to stay close to Earth week)
  - Weeks in a month (can standardize; elements, etc.)
  - Months in a year (can change; recommended 11 or 13; use suffixes like "-mon" for recognition; reveal count through narration, not exposition)
  - Example passages showing how to reveal time differences naturally through dialogue
  - Calculating actual year length vs. Earth (Llurien example: 336 days = 29 fewer than Earth)
  - Hours in a day (similar to Earth recommended; different sleep cycles in SF)
- Universal calendar:
  - Benefits (reconciling dates across powers; needed even if characters don't use it)
  - How to create (globally accepted event: birth of magic, cataclysm, mass exodus)
  - Naming convention (B.M./A.M. for Before Magic/After Magic, etc.)
  - Challenges (season-based month names fail across hemispheres; avoid seasonal associations)
  - Start the year with an event unrelated to weather/seasons
- Creating ages (Stone Age, Elven Age, Interstellar Age; typically thousands of years; current age may lack a name)
- Uses for history (enriching present, creating world figures, artifacts, mysteries, layering connections, source material for stories)
- Historical event categories:
  - The Gods (interference, sacred places, powerful items, killed/imprisoned gods, anniversaries)
  - Technological Events (missions, launches, discoveries, first contact, vessel classes)
  - Supernatural Events (phenomena, magic discoveries, famous practitioners, items)
  - Rise and Fall of Sovereign Powers (treaties, conquests, collapse impacts)
  - Wars (reasons: resources, territory, ethnic cleansing, pride, legacy grievances)
  - Groups Forming (military orders, knight orders, wizard orders, dragon riders)
  - Artifacts Discovered/Invented (magic items, legendary devices, prophecies)
  - Missions Undertaken (exploration, rescue, investigation; outcomes known or secret)
- Where to start (random creation; cross-reference with subject files; biggest items in world history)

### Key Discussions
- History entries should be summaries, not detailed accounts
- 10 minutes of history brainstorming can produce a wealth of worldbuilding material
- Minutes and hours should stay Earth-like to avoid confusing the audience
- Reveal time differences through character dialogue, not exposition
- A universal calendar is essential for the worldbuilder's notes even if characters don't use it
- Season-based names for months fail across hemispheres
- Former enemies can become allies surprisingly quickly (within generations)
- History should be created piecemeal, not all at once

### Concepts to Internalize
- Keep minutes and hours Earth-like; change weeks, months, and year length instead
- Show time differences through character dialogue (natural narration technique)
- A universal calendar is needed for your files regardless of what characters use
- History entries are summaries with a date, title, and paragraph
- Cross-file everything: when you create a history item, update all related files
- Historical event categories provide a checklist for brainstorming
- Wars need reasons: resources, territory, ethnicity, pride, or legacy grievances

### Template Suggestions
**Time System Template**
- Fields: Minutes in an hour (recommend 60); Hours in a day; Days in a week (with day names and their origin/meaning); Weeks in a month (with week names if applicable); Days in a month; Months in a year (with month names, any suffix convention, associated seasons or events); Total days in a year; Year length compared to Earth; Universal calendar event (what year zero represents); Calendar notation (e.g., B.M./A.M.); Named ages (name, approximate span, defining characteristic)

**History Entry Template**
- Fields: Date (universal calendar); Title; Summary (1-2 paragraph description); Category (Gods/Technology/Supernatural/Sovereign Power/War/Group/Artifact/Mission); Related files to update (which sovereign power, item, creature, or land feature files need entries); Outcome; Impact on present day; Known to characters (yes/no/partially)

**World History Timeline**
- Organized chronologically with columns: Date; Event title; Category; Sovereign powers involved; Key figures; Items/artifacts; Location; Outcome; Present-day relevance

- Chapter 5 (Creating a Sovereign Power) for powers whose history is being created
- Chapter 4 (Creating Land Features) for locations where events occur
- Volume 1 for gods, world figures, species, and creatures referenced in history
- All previous chapters contribute context for historical events

### Progression Milestones

- Universal calendar established with a year-zero event
- At least one named age defined
- At least 5-10 history entries created using the sample format
- History entries cross-filed to relevant sovereign power, item, and creature files
- Month and day naming conventions established

## Chapter 11: Creating Places of Interest

### Core Concept
Catalogs the types of noteworthy locations that add depth and adventure to a world -- from ordinary places like catacombs and monuments, to extraordinary ones like underwater cities and floating settlements, to phenomena, ruins, shipwrecks, event sites, and meteor impacts. These are the adventure hooks and set pieces of worldbuilding.

### Topics
- Ordinary places:
  - Catacombs and hidden passages (military, royalty, dwarves, abandoned tunnels, secret training)
  - Step wells (elaborate water wells with flights of stairs; Indian inspiration)
  - Monuments (buildings, monoliths, statues; condition and vandalism; Seven Wonders model)
  - Graves (catacombs with stacked bones, mausoleums, unique layouts, day of the dead festivals, lone grave sites)
- Extraordinary places:
  - Underwater settlements (dry areas for land species, air pockets, portals, weapons practice)
  - Floating settlements (magic/technology/unexplained physics; flying species; trade difficulties; storm vulnerability; Venice-style water settlements)
  - Other unusual homes (hill homes like Hobbits, mountain homes like dwarves, tree homes for flyers)
- Phenomena:
  - Space phenomena (nebulas, radiation, alien environments; flexible location)
  - Planetary phenomena (technological/magical disasters; experiments gone wrong; monsters as result)
  - Related phenomena in different locations (layering connections)
  - Places where magic/technology doesn't work, is unpredictable, or supercharged
  - Gateways/portals (to physical locations, supernatural places, alternate realities; predictable or not; who can activate them)
  - Earth analogues (Bermuda Triangle, crop circles, Area 51, Stonehenge, Easter Island)
- Ruins:
  - Range from caves to entire planets/galaxies
  - Scale of abandonment suggests scale of calamity
  - Overgrowth depends on climate (rainforest consumes quickly; exposed locations erode)
  - Building durability (roof fails first; stone lasts centuries; locals steal materials)
  - Magical/technological items left behind (cursed objects, empowering random creatures)
  - Groups dedicated to finding and neutralizing dangerous items
- Shipwrecks:
  - Wooden ships (partially submerged; water-dwelling species plunder them)
  - SF shipwrecks (space, planetary surface, underwater; ship graveyards in orbit)
  - Source of fame (remote location, famous ship, famous captain, cargo, creature inhabiting, cause of demise)
  - Combine no more than two reasons for fame
- Event sites:
  - Famous battles, religious sites, first/last instances, natural phenomena (geysers, sinkholes, aurora borealis), solitary mountains/volcanoes
  - The story associated with a site is what makes it interesting
- Meteors (craters, myths, alien life, worship sites, rare minerals in SF)
- Where to start (wars/battles as sources; decide location type and impact; create creature first if monster origin desired)

### Key Discussions
- Not every location needs to be spectacular; anything unusual qualifies
- Ruins are most fun when the truth about what happened exceeds audience expectations
- Building durability varies by material: roof fails first, stone lasts centuries, advanced tech may last indefinitely
- Shipwreck fame should combine no more than two factors
- Phenomena can be layered: seemingly unrelated phenomena revealed to be connected
- Groups dedicated to finding dangerous artifacts make great organizations
- Floating settlements must address storms, trade logistics, and sabotage vulnerability

### Concepts to Internalize
- Places of interest are adventure hooks; create them where you need story catalysts
- Ruins should have a mystery with a truth that exceeds expectations
- The story associated with a place is what makes it interesting, not the place itself
- Climate determines how quickly ruins are consumed (rainforest fast, desert slow)
- Shipwrecks need a source of fame and a reason for interest
- Phenomena can be layered for depth (seemingly unrelated things connected)
- Dangerous items left behind in ruins are story generators

### Template Suggestions
**Place of Interest Profile Template**
- Fields: Name; Type (catacomb/monument/ruin/shipwreck/phenomenon/event site/extraordinary settlement); Location (settlement, region, coordinates); Known or unknown to inhabitants; Current condition (pristine/deteriorating/overgrown/buried/active); Origin/cause (natural, technological, magical, battle, experiment); Age; What happened here (summary); What is here now (creatures, items, dangers, treasure); Who knows about it; Who is interested in it (heroes, villains, governments, scholars); Access difficulty; Story associated with it; Related world figures; Related artifacts/items; Impact on surrounding area; Notes for story use

**Shipwreck Profile Template**
- Fields: Ship name; Ship type; Sovereign power; Captain; Location (surface/underwater/space/orbit); Cause of loss; Crew fate (dead/captured/marooned/unknown); Famous for (max 2 reasons); Cargo/items aboard; Current inhabitant (creature, salvagers, none); Condition; Recovery attempts (past or planned); Related events/wars

**Phenomenon Catalog**
- Fields: Name; Location(s); Type (magical dead zone, portal, supercharged area, unexplained); Cause (known/speculated/unknown); Effects on people; Effects on magic/technology; Effects on creatures; Related phenomena; Activation conditions; Danger level; Story potential

### Dependencies
- Chapter 4 (Creating Land Features) for locations where places of interest exist
- Chapter 5 (Creating a Sovereign Power) for powers connected to ruins and events
- Chapter 6 (Creating a Settlement) for settlements containing or near places of interest
- Chapter 8 (Travel by Water) for shipwreck context
- Chapter 10 (Creating Time and History) for historical events that created these places
- Volume 1 for creatures, items, gods, and world figures associated with these places

### Progression Milestones
- At least 3-5 places of interest created across different types
- At least one ruin with a mystery and a truth that exceeds surface appearance
- At least one phenomenon with effects on magic, technology, or creatures
- Any shipwrecks have a source of fame and current state defined
- Places cross-referenced to history timeline and relevant sovereign powers
- At least one place has a dangerous item or creature as a story hook

## Chapter 12: Bonus -- Drawing Maps

### Core Concept
A practical guide to creating maps of all types -- continental, settlement, dungeon, and ship -- covering whether to draw one, how to create them (with and without artistic skill), software recommendations, and the author's personal process using Campaign Cartographer 3 and Fractal Terrains.

### Topics
- Advantages of maps (visualization, travel calculation, inspiration, avoiding impossible scenarios, memory aid)
- Continental maps:
  - Should you draw one? (long-term worlds yes; one-off stories maybe not; travel calculation benefit; Game of Thrones example)
  - Alternative: base locations on Earth ones (use England as a country, just rename it)
  - How to create one:
    - Continent first approach: decide size (Earth analogue), draw coastline (steal edges from real continents), decide latitude/hemisphere for climate, place mountain ranges using tectonic knowledge, determine rain shadows, place rivers and settlements at water, fill in vegetation
    - Local region first approach: decide story needs (weather, latitude), choose hemisphere and wind direction, place mountains and determine rain shadows, expand outward as needed
  - Author's process with Campaign Cartographer 3 + Fractal Terrains:
    - Generate continent shapes with button clicks
    - Screen capture, crop, import to CC3
    - Trace outline, add mountains (foothills first, then peaks, top to bottom)
    - Add rivers, lakes, vegetation (rain shadow logic), settlements at water
    - Add farmland, bridges, roads between settlements
    - Use color-coded settlement icons for different sovereign powers
- Drawing the world (Fractal Terrains for whole planet, then detail each continent)
- Settlement maps:
  - Should you draw one? (game designers yes; authors maybe not; layout can be noted in files instead)
  - How to create one: water supply first, then Old Town, then wealthy area, then species quarters, then zoning, then neighborhoods with character, then roads and walls
  - Urban planning considerations (zones, infrastructure, wealthy vs. poor areas)
  - City Designer 3 software
- Dungeon and ship maps:
  - Should you draw one? (gamers yes; authors need consistency more than a map)
  - Dungeon rooms (cells, guard stations, weapons rooms, torture chambers, etc.)
  - Ship layout consistency (deck number + fore/aft/port/starboard)
  - Graph paper for dungeons; reference images for ship interiors
  - Cosmographer 3 for spaceships
- Map generation software (ProFantasy suite: Campaign Cartographer 3, City Designer, Dungeon Designer, Cosmographer)

### Key Discussions
- You don't need to be an artist to create maps; software places pre-existing icons
- "Not drawn to scale" provides essential leeway
- Stealing coastline edges from real continents is a legitimate technique
- Mountains should be placed before anything else on a continent map (they determine everything)
- Top-to-bottom workflow prevents icon overlap issues in software
- Color-coded settlement icons help distinguish sovereign power boundaries
- Settlement maps can actually interfere with readers forming their own mental pictures
- For books, noting locations in files may be better than drawing maps
- Dungeon layout should make logical sense (room types and their relationships)

### Concepts to Internalize
- Maps are tools for the worldbuilder first, audience second
- Coastlines can be assembled from pieces of real-world coastlines
- The continental map creation workflow: coastline > latitude/hemisphere > mountains > rain shadows > rivers > settlements > vegetation
- Settlement maps start with water, then Old Town, then expand outward
- "Not drawn to scale" is essential protection
- Software exists that requires zero drawing skill (Campaign Cartographer suite)
- For ships and dungeons, consistency matters more than detailed maps

### Template Suggestions
**Map Creation Checklist -- Continental**
- Steps: 1. Decide continent size (Earth analogue); 2. Draw or generate coastline shape; 3. Determine hemisphere and latitude range; 4. Identify prevailing wind directions; 5. Place mountain ranges (coastal first, then interior); 6. Determine rain shadow directions; 7. Place deserts on leeward sides of mountains; 8. Draw major rivers (mountains to sea); 9. Place major lakes; 10. Place settlements at water sources; 11. Fill in forest types (windward = lush, leeward = desert-to-grassland-to-forest gradient); 12. Add roads between settlements; 13. Mark sovereign power boundaries; 14. Label all features; 15. Add "Not drawn to scale"

**Map Creation Checklist -- Settlement**
- Steps: 1. Draw water supply (river, lake, well); 2. Place Old Town near water; 3. Place castle/fortification at defensible high point; 4. Place wealthy area (upstream, high ground, or park-adjacent); 5. Place species quarters; 6. Place industrial zone (downstream, away from residential); 7. Place commercial zones near residential; 8. Draw main roads and gates; 9. Draw city wall (if applicable); 10. Fill in neighborhoods with character notes; 11. Add farmland outside walls; 12. Note any extramural buildings

**Map Software Reference**
- Continental/regional: Campaign Cartographer 3 + Fractal Terrains
- Settlements: City Designer 3
- Dungeons: Dungeon Designer
- Spaceships/star maps: Cosmographer 3
