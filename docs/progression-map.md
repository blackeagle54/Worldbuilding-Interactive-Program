> **A note about this map:** The book's original volume order is Life, Places, Cultures. This map reorders significantly. Some culture work comes before settlement design (because culture shapes settlements). Some life work comes after geography (because habitat shapes creatures). The supernatural and magic come after civilizations are built (because magic's impact depends on knowing what society looks like without it). This is a creation order, not a reading order.

---

## Phase 1: FOUNDATION

*"Before you build a world, decide what kind of builder you are."*

This phase produces no world content. It produces the strategy and principles that govern everything you create afterward.

---

### Step 1: Define Your World Building Scope and Strategy

**What you do:** Decide whether you are building one world or many, how many stories this world will serve, and what medium you are working in (novel, game, film, etc.). Write down your exposition strategy -- how will you reveal world details to your audience?

**What it produces:** A completed World Building Strategy Worksheet.

**Templates needed:**
- World Building Strategy Worksheet

**Dependencies:** None. This is the starting point.

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 1 -- Why Build a World?

---

### Step 2: Learn and Practice the Rule of Three

**What you do:** Study the Rule of Three: whenever you base something on a real-world source (an "analogue"), you must make at least three significant changes so it is not obviously recognizable. Practice by picking one real-world thing (a culture, creature, or historical figure) and modifying it three ways.

**What it produces:** An understanding of the Rule of Three and at least one practice entry in the Analogue Modification Log.

**Templates needed:**
- Analogue Modification Log

**Dependencies:** None.

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 1 -- Why Build a World?

---

### Step 3: Establish Your Naming Philosophy

**What you do:** Decide your approach to naming. When you change something from its real-world source, how much change warrants a new name? Using a known term (like "elf") gives instant recognition but locks in expectations. A new term requires explanation but gives full creative freedom. Write down your guiding principle.

**What it produces:** A written naming philosophy statement you will refer to throughout the project.

**Templates needed:** None (this is a short written statement added to your Strategy Worksheet).

**Dependencies:** Step 2 (the Rule of Three informs naming decisions).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 1 -- Why Build a World?

---

### Step 4: Set Your World Building Goals

**What you do:** Answer these questions: What is your primary goal (storytelling, gaming, hobby)? How much time can you commit per week? What elements must be created versus what is optional? What is your priority order? Write this down so you do not get overwhelmed later.

**What it produces:** A completed Worldbuilding Goals Worksheet.

**Templates needed:**
- Worldbuilding Goals Worksheet

**Dependencies:** Step 1 (scope informs goals).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 11 -- Conclusion

---

### Step 5: Set Up Your File Organization

**What you do:** Create your folder structure and file system before you start building anything. Decide where files will live, how they will be named, how you will back them up, and create a "changes to make" file for capturing ideas without losing focus.

**What it produces:** A ready-to-use folder structure, backup plan, and a blank "changes to make" file.

**Templates needed:**
- File Organization Template

**Dependencies:** Step 4 (goals inform what folders you need).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 11 -- Conclusion

---

## Phase 2: COSMOLOGY

*"Start with the biggest things -- the gods and the sky -- because everything else flows from them."*

---

### Step 6: Design Your Pantheon Structure

**What you do:** Decide how your gods are organized. Are they a family? Organized by elements, traits, or domains? How many gods exist? What is the power hierarchy? What rules govern behavior among gods, and what happens when those rules are broken? Also decide: are gods real, imagined, or ambiguous in your world?

**What it produces:** A completed Pantheon Overview Sheet.

**Templates needed:**
- Pantheon Overview Sheet

**Dependencies:** Steps 1-3 (scope, Rule of Three, and naming philosophy).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 2 -- Creating Gods

---

### Step 7: Create Individual God Profiles

**What you do:** For each god in your pantheon, define their primary domain (war, love, death, etc.), alignment, symbol, personality, power level, appearance, and relationships with other gods. Each god needs at minimum: a domain, an alignment, a symbol, and at least one relationship.

**What it produces:** A God Profile for each deity (aim for at least 3-5 gods).

**Templates needed:**
- God Profile Template

**Dependencies:** Step 6 (pantheon structure must exist first).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 2 -- Creating Gods

---

### Step 8: Write Creation and End-of-World Myths

**What you do:** Write at least one creation myth (how the world began) and one end-of-world myth (how it might end). These are the most important myths to develop. Decide what is true, what is distorted, and what the inhabitants believe versus what actually happened.

**What it produces:** At least two completed Mythology Worksheets (one creation myth, one end-of-world myth).

**Templates needed:**
- Mythology Worksheet

**Dependencies:** Step 7 (gods must exist to star in myths).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 2 -- Creating Gods

---

### Step 9: Write Additional Myths

**What you do:** Write at least one additional myth involving gods interacting with each other or with mortals. These myths will later connect to species, cultures, religions, and history.

**What it produces:** One or more additional completed Mythology Worksheets.

**Templates needed:**
- Mythology Worksheet

**Dependencies:** Step 8 (creation myth should come first).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 10-12 (planet and continent creation).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 2 -- Creating Gods

---

### Step 10: Define Your Planet

**What you do:** Make global-scale decisions: What type of star does your planet orbit? Which direction does the planet rotate? How many moons does it have, and what are their sizes and orbital periods? What is the axial tilt (this determines seasons)? Where is the equator? Define prevailing wind directions by latitude zone (trade winds, westerlies, polar winds). Understand how rain shadows work (mountains block moisture, creating deserts on the far side).

**What it produces:** A completed Planet Profile Template and Climate Zone Reference Sheet.

**Templates needed:**
- Planet Profile Template
- Climate Zone Reference Sheet

**Dependencies:** Step 7 (god profiles help with constellation naming).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 2 -- Creating a Planet

---

### Step 11: Create Constellations

**What you do:** Name key constellations visible in the night sky. Associate them with gods or world figures. Decide which are visible from each hemisphere and during which seasons. Consider "dark constellations" (gas clouds that block starlight).

**What it produces:** A set of named constellations added to the Planet Profile.

**Templates needed:**
- Planet Profile Template (constellation section)

**Dependencies:** Step 7 (gods to associate with constellations), Step 10 (equator determines hemisphere visibility).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 12-13 (continent work).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 2 -- Creating a Planet

---

## Phase 3: THE LAND

*"Shape the continents. Mountains come first, because they determine everything else."*

---

### Step 12: Design Your Continent Shape and Position

**What you do:** Decide your continent's overall shape, which hemisphere it occupies, and its latitude range (how close to the equator). Understand plate tectonics enough to know where mountains and volcanoes should form. Identify major water bodies (seas, bays, straits) and islands. Give other continents at least a name, reputation, and rough description even if you will not detail them.

**What it produces:** A completed Continent Profile Template and Water Body Reference Sheet.

**Templates needed:**
- Continent Profile Template
- Water Body Reference Sheet

**Dependencies:** Step 10 (planetary data determines climate zones and winds).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 3 -- Creating a Continent

---

### Step 13: Place Mountains and Determine Rain Shadows

**What you do:** Place mountain ranges on your continent. Coastal ranges come from ocean-to-continent plate convergence (with volcanoes). Interior ranges come from continent-to-continent convergence (tallest mountains, no volcanoes). Then determine rain shadow direction: prevailing winds hit mountains, dump moisture on the windward side (lush vegetation), and leave the leeward side dry (desert or grassland). This single step determines where most forests and deserts go.

**What it produces:** Mountain entries in the Land Feature Catalog, with rain shadow directions marked.

**Templates needed:**
- Land Feature Catalog Template (mountain section)

**Dependencies:** Step 10 (prevailing wind directions), Step 12 (continent shape and plate boundaries).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 4 -- Creating Land Features

---

### Step 14: Place Rivers, Lakes, and Water Features

**What you do:** Draw major rivers flowing from mountains to the sea. Young rivers (near mountains) are straight and fast. Old rivers (near coast) meander and flood. Place major lakes. Rivers are natural national boundaries. Remember: settlements will be placed at water sources later.

**What it produces:** Water feature entries in the Land Feature Catalog.

**Templates needed:**
- Land Feature Catalog Template (water features section)

**Dependencies:** Step 13 (rivers flow from mountains).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 4 -- Creating Land Features

---

### Step 15: Place Forests, Grasslands, Deserts, and Wetlands

**What you do:** Using your rain shadow map, place forests on the windward (wet) side of mountains and deserts on the leeward (dry) side. Fill in grasslands in between. Add wetlands near rivers and coasts. Characterize each: forest type (forest, woodland, savannah, jungle, rainforest), desert type (hot, cold, sand, rocky -- remember 80% of deserts are rocky, not sandy), and wetland type (bog, fen, marsh, swamp). Note which species and creatures will live in each.

**What it produces:** Forest, desert, grassland, and wetland entries in the Land Feature Catalog.

**Templates needed:**
- Land Feature Catalog Template (forest, desert, wetland sections)

**Dependencies:** Step 13 (rain shadows determine placement), Step 14 (water features affect wetland placement).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 4 -- Creating Land Features

---

## Phase 4: LIFE

*"Now that the land exists, populate it."*

---

### Step 16: Decide on Species Strategy

**What you do:** Decide whether you will use public domain species (elves, dwarves), create entirely new ones, or both. If creating alongside public domain species, understand the bar is high -- audiences will compare. Establish the distinction between "species" (different DNA) and "race" (variations within a species, like high elf vs. dark elf).

**What it produces:** A written decision on species strategy and a blank Race Hierarchy Chart.

**Templates needed:**
- Race Hierarchy Chart

**Dependencies:** Steps 1-3 (scope, Rule of Three, naming).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 13-15 (land creation), since species design needs habitat but habitat design can proceed independently.

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 3 -- Creating a Species

---

### Step 17: Define Species Habitats and Core Traits

**What you do:** For each species, define their preferred habitat (terrain, climate, settlement type). Habitat is the single most influential factor -- water-dwelling species need gills, underground species are shorter with better night vision, forest species may be isolated. Also define their overall disposition (good, evil, complex) and assign which gods created or influence them.

**What it produces:** Habitat, disposition, and god-connection sections of each Species Profile.

**Templates needed:**
- Species Profile Template (habitat and disposition sections)

**Dependencies:** Step 7 (gods as creators), Steps 13-15 (land features as habitats), Step 16 (species strategy).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 3 -- Creating a Species

---

### Step 18: Design Species Appearance and Senses

**What you do:** For each species, define their physical appearance (head, body, height, distinguishing features) and senses. Altering one or two senses per species provides meaningful differences without overwhelming the audience. Consider sixth senses (telepathy, precognition) and exotic senses (magnetoception, magiception).

**What it produces:** Appearance and senses sections of each Species Profile.

**Templates needed:**
- Species Profile Template (appearance and senses sections)

**Dependencies:** Step 17 (habitat shapes bodies).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Step 19 (world view).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 3 -- Creating a Species

---

### Step 19: Write Species World Views

**What you do:** For each species, write a paragraph describing how they see themselves, others, and their place in the world. This is the most important differentiator from humans. Ask: "What are the stupid aspects of humanity, and how would this species handle them differently?" Consider the Spock model -- a fundamentally different way of thinking.

**What it produces:** World view paragraphs for each species.

**Templates needed:**
- Species Profile Template (world view section)

**Dependencies:** Step 17 (disposition and god influence shape world view).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Step 18 (appearance).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 3 -- Creating a Species

---

### Step 20: Define Species Society, Language, and Customs

**What you do:** For each species, sketch their government type, marriage and family norms, key laws, spoken and written languages, and customs (greetings, ceremonies, taboos). Also define characteristics (intelligence, wisdom, charisma, strength, constitution, agility, dexterity, morale) and technology level.

**What it produces:** Society, language, customs, characteristics, and technology sections of each Species Profile.

**Templates needed:**
- Species Profile Template (remaining sections)

**Dependencies:** Steps 18-19 (appearance and world view inform society).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 3 -- Creating a Species

---

### Step 21: Map Species Relationships

**What you do:** For every pair of species, define their relationship: allies, enemies, neutral, or complicated. Note key historical events between them and the stereotypes each holds about the other. A hero to one species may be a villain to another.

**What it produces:** A completed Species Relationship Matrix.

**Templates needed:**
- Species Relationship Matrix

**Dependencies:** Step 20 (species must be defined before relationships).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 3 -- Creating a Species

---

### Step 22: Create Plants and Animals (Purpose-Driven)

**What you do:** Start with a products list: What do your inhabitants need? (Leather, ink, poison, riding animals, spell components, food, medicine, building materials.) Then invent the plant or animal that provides each product. This ensures every creation has a purpose. Aim for 3-5 animals across different types (mammal, bird, reptile, etc.) and 3-5 plants with defined uses.

**What it produces:** A Products-to-Source Mapping Table, plus Plant Profile and Animal Profile entries.

**Templates needed:**
- Products-to-Source Mapping Table
- Plant Profile Template
- Animal Profile Template

**Dependencies:** Step 17 (species habitats inform what life exists where), Steps 13-15 (land features determine ecosystems).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 23-24 (monsters and undead).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 6 -- Creating Plants and Animals

---

### Step 23: Create Monsters

**What you do:** Design at least one monster. Figure out its origin (accidental, designed, or evolved) and motivation (isolation, hoarding, food, security, revenge) BEFORE its appearance. A monster's backstory is more memorable than its looks. Design its lair (contents reveal character without exposition). Define what makes it different from a species (monsters lack sophistication and society) and from an animal (monsters are typically singular).

**What it produces:** At least one completed Monster Profile with origin, motivation, lair, and appearance.

**Templates needed:**
- Monster Profile Template

**Dependencies:** Step 7 (gods may have created the monster), Steps 16-19 (species provide contrast), Steps 13-15 (land features for habitat).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 22, 24.

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 5 -- Creating Monsters

---

### Step 24: Create Undead (If Applicable)

**What you do:** Decide whether to create original undead types or use existing ones (vampires, zombies, ghosts). If creating new types, focus on what makes them distinct: unique goals (unfinished business, regaining life, causing torment), unique behavior patterns, and unique destruction methods. Define prerequisites for becoming undead -- these become cultural burial customs for the living.

**What it produces:** Undead Type Profiles (if applicable) and notes on how undead existence affects living cultures.

**Templates needed:**
- Undead Type Profile Template

**Dependencies:** Step 7 (gods and afterlife concepts), Steps 16-20 (species customs around death), Step 22 (undead animals build on animal creation).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 22, 23.

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 7 -- Creating Undead

---

## Phase 5: CIVILIZATION

*"The land is shaped and populated. Now build the nations and the places people actually live."*

This is where the book's volume order gets significantly reordered. Cultures (Volume 3) come before settlements (Volume 2) because culture shapes how settlements look, feel, and function.

---

### Step 25: Create Sovereign Powers (Nations)

**What you do:** Design at least 2-3 sovereign powers with distinct government types (monarchy, republic, empire, theocracy, etc.). For each, define the head of state and head of government, population breakdown by species, official languages, world view (2-3 driving ideas), location on the continent, climate, relationships with neighbors (at least one ally and one enemy with reasons), and identifiers (symbol, colors, flag, slogan, reputation). Track previous government types for historical depth.

**What it produces:** Completed Sovereign Power Profile Templates.

**Templates needed:**
- Sovereign Power Profile Template

**Dependencies:** Steps 12-15 (continent and land features for placement), Steps 16-21 (species to populate each power).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 5 -- Creating a Sovereign Power

---

### Step 26: Define Cultures for Each Sovereign Power

**What you do:** For each sovereign power, define the foundational ideas (values, beliefs, morals) that drive its culture, then derive visible, audible, and performed cultural manifestations from those ideas. Start with a cultural vision (formal, exuberant, timid, brash, modest, calculating) and make sure all manifestations are consistent with it. Define social classes (elite, upper middle, lower middle, working, poor) and how culture varies between them.

**What it produces:** A Culture Profile Template and Cultural Manifestations Sheet for each sovereign power.

**Templates needed:**
- Culture Profile Template
- Cultural Manifestations Sheet

**Dependencies:** Step 25 (sovereign powers provide the frame for culture), Steps 16-20 (species traits influence culture).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 1 -- Cultures

---

### Step 27: Design Cultural Details -- Greetings, Dining, Clothing, Daily Life

**What you do:** For each culture, define the practical details that will actually appear in scenes: How do people greet each other and say farewell? What is dining etiquette? What do people wear, and what does clothing signal about status? What does daily life look like (work hours, bathing, sleeping, transportation, pastimes)? Define at least one holiday, ceremony, or festival. Invent a few swear words and colloquialisms.

**What it produces:** Completed Cultural Manifestations Sheets with scene-ready details.

**Templates needed:**
- Cultural Manifestations Sheet (detailed sections)

**Dependencies:** Step 26 (cultural vision and values must be established first).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 1 -- Cultures

---

### Step 28: Plan Cultural Clashes

**What you do:** For each pair of cultures that will interact in your stories, identify the key differences that could cause misunderstandings, offense, or conflict. Rate the severity (minor awkwardness, serious insult, potentially deadly). Note how you might use each clash in a story.

**What it produces:** Completed Cultural Clash Planner entries.

**Templates needed:**
- Cultural Clash Planner

**Dependencies:** Step 27 (cultural details must exist to clash).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 29-30 (settlement creation).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 1 -- Cultures

---

### Step 29: Create Settlements -- Major Cities and Towns

**What you do:** Design at least one fully detailed settlement (city or town level). Always place settlements near water (river, lake, spring, well). For each settlement define: type (outpost, castle, village, town, city), sovereign power, climate, terrain, population size and species breakdown, leadership, species quarters, zoning, fortifications (designed against specific threats), history (conquests leave architectural marks), reputation, products, colors, symbol, and at least one secret.

**What it produces:** At least one completed Settlement Profile Template.

**Templates needed:**
- Settlement Profile Template

**Dependencies:** Steps 14-15 (water features and terrain for placement), Step 25 (sovereign power), Steps 26-27 (culture shapes settlement character).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 6 -- Creating a Settlement

---

### Step 30: Create a Settlement Master Spreadsheet

**What you do:** Start a spreadsheet listing every settlement in your world, even those not fully detailed. Columns: Name, Sovereign Power, Location, Population Size, Species Percentages, Products, Symbol, Colors, Military, Reputation, Notes. This prevents duplicate symbols and provides a quick reference.

**What it produces:** A Settlement Master Spreadsheet with at least basic entries for all planned settlements.

**Templates needed:**
- Settlement Master Spreadsheet

**Dependencies:** Step 29 (at least one settlement must be detailed first to establish the pattern).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 31-35 (society phase).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 6 -- Creating a Settlement

---

## Phase 6: SOCIETY

*"Nations and cities exist. Now fill them with the institutions people actually interact with."*

---

### Step 31: Create Religions

**What you do:** For each major god or subset of the pantheon, design a religion. Start with the founding story (a prophetic figure, the event that started the faith, and what happened to the prophet). The founding story generates symbols, relics, holy sites, and rituals. Define beliefs (what followers think the god wants), worship practices, requirements for followers, holidays, clergy structure, and the afterlife (is it real or imagined? paradise, rebirth, oblivion, or torture?).

**What it produces:** A Religion Profile, Religion History Sheet, Beliefs and Practices Template, Clergy Profile, and Afterlife Design Sheet for each major religion.

**Templates needed:**
- Religion Profile Template
- Religion History Sheet
- Religion Beliefs and Practices Template
- Religion Membership Sheet
- Clergy Profile Template
- Afterlife Design Sheet

**Dependencies:** Steps 7-9 (gods and myths), Steps 16-21 (species as followers), Step 25 (sovereign powers for state religion interactions).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 4 -- Religions

---

### Step 32: Create Organizations

**What you do:** Design at least one force for good and one force for evil. For each, define their world view, goals (not just "power" -- layer complexity), power structure, symbol and identity markers, and relationships with other entities. Define how people join (evil groups may kill failed recruits; good groups let people leave) and how people leave (evil groups often kill defectors). Write a formation story and at least 3-6 historical actions.

**What it produces:** Completed Organization Profiles, Membership Sheets, History Logs, and Relationships Matrices.

**Templates needed:**
- Organization Profile Template
- Organization Membership Sheet
- Organization History Log
- Organization Relationships Matrix

**Dependencies:** Step 25 (sovereign powers for jurisdiction), Step 26 (cultures for underlying values), Step 31 (religions if the organization is religiously motivated).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 33-34.

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 2 -- Organizations

---

### Step 33: Create Armed Forces

**What you do:** Design military groups for your sovereign powers. Define purpose, terrain specialization, transportation, required and preferred weapons, armor by rank, and special sites (training facilities, sacred places). Map the membership pipeline: prerequisites, initiation tests, training, final tests. Define the rank structure (at least high-level), troop numbers (use population ratios), and relationships with other military groups (on a 7-level scale from cooperation to open conflict). Create at least one military custom (a toast, greeting, or burial ritual).

**What it produces:** Completed Armed Forces Profiles, Military Membership Pipelines, Rank Structures, Relationships Sheets, and History/Lore Logs.

**Templates needed:**
- Armed Forces Profile Template
- Military Membership Pipeline
- Military Rank Structure
- Military Relationships Sheet
- Military History and Lore Log

**Dependencies:** Step 25 (government type shapes military character), Steps 13-15 (terrain for specialization), Steps 29-30 (settlements where forces are based), Step 26 (culture for military customs).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 32, 34.

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 3 -- Armed Forces

---

### Step 34: Design Societal Systems (Education, Health, Legal, Commerce, Information, Games)

**What you do:** For each sovereign power, define six systems at a level appropriate to your story needs:

1. **Education:** Is basic education available? Special education? How do apprenticeships work?
2. **Health:** What is life expectancy? Is magical healing available? What is the medical knowledge level?
3. **Legal:** What type of legal system (civil, common, religious)? Create at least 5 moral laws and 5 incident laws. Define trial types and punishments -- leverage your invented creatures and places for unique punishments.
4. **Commerce:** What currency system exists? Create denominations and names. Use real-world pricing as a baseline (a meal costs X coins, a weapon costs Y coins) and adjust consistently.
5. **Information:** How does news travel? Messengers, town criers, magic, or technology?
6. **Games/Sports:** What games and sports exist in your world? Take existing Earth games and modify or combine them, especially by substituting your invented creatures and species. Consider how different species' physical or mental attributes create advantages that require special rules or restrictions (e.g., only one elf per team, dwarves excluded due to height). Decide whether games are recreational, professional, or both. Define the key elements: teams, players, rules, items/equipment, scoring, and tournaments. Even a briefly mentioned game adds cultural texture.

**What it produces:** Completed templates for Education, Health, Legal, Commerce, Information, and Game systems.

**Templates needed:**
- Education System Template
- Health System Template
- Legal System Template
- Commerce System Template
- Information System Template
- Game Profile Template

**Dependencies:** Step 25 (government type determines all systems), Steps 29-30 (settlement infrastructure), Step 26 (cultural values influence laws and customs), Step 31 (religious law, healing priests).

## Phase 7: THE SUPERNATURAL

*"With society built, now decide how magic and the supernatural transform it."*

The supernatural comes after civilization is established because the most important question is: "How does magic change the world you just built?" You need to know what daily life looks like before you can assess magic's impact on it.

---

### Step 35: Decide Supernatural Prevalence

**What you do:** Make the single most important supernatural decision: How common is the supernatural in your world? (Rare, uncommon, common, or ubiquitous.) Then perform the thought exercise: if magic is common, what industries vanish? What professions change? How does transportation, law enforcement, healthcare, and warfare transform? Define society's attitudes toward the supernatural by species, class, and region.

**What it produces:** A completed Supernatural Prevalence Worksheet.

**Templates needed:**
- Supernatural Prevalence Worksheet

**Dependencies:** Steps 25-34 (you need to know what society looks like before assessing magic's impact on it).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 5 -- The Supernatural

---

### Step 36: Define Supernatural Elements (Energies, Paths, Beings)

**What you do:** If your world has supernatural energy, name it and define its properties (appearance, temperature, detection range, conditions for occurrence). If magic paths exist (alternate travel routes), define their doorways, advantages, and dangers. Create any supernatural beings (demi-gods, familiars, supernatural creatures). Document past incidents involving the supernatural.

**What it produces:** Supernatural Energy Templates, Magic Path Templates, and Supernatural Being Templates as applicable.

**Templates needed:**
- Supernatural Energy Template
- Magic Path / Supernatural Land Template
- Supernatural Being Template

**Dependencies:** Step 35 (prevalence determines scope), Step 7 (gods as source of supernatural), Step 31 (religions for afterlife connections).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 5 -- The Supernatural

---

### Step 37: Design Your Magic System(s)

**What you do:** Define the laws of your magic using Ellefson's Seven Laws: (1) Decide what is possible and impossible. (2) Define who can perform magic and how common they are. (3) Define types of magic and how they interact. (4) Determine what happens when magic fails. (5) Decide local laws governing magic. (6) Follow your own rules -- audiences notice inconsistency. (7) Define how magic is taught and learned. Decide if your system is hard (rule-based, predictable), soft (mysterious, flexible), or in between. Define the cost of magic (fatigue, aging, madness).

**What it produces:** Completed Magic System Overview, Magic System Rules Sheet, and Magic Type Detail Templates.

**Templates needed:**
- Magic System Overview Template
- Magic System Rules Sheet
- Magic Type Detail Template

**Dependencies:** Step 35 (prevalence), Step 36 (supernatural energy as foundation).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 6 -- Magic Systems

---

### Step 38: Create Spells and Magic Training

**What you do:** Design at least 3-5 example spells (or document your approach to spell creation). Spells are recipes: gestures control area and distance, ingredients serve specific functions, words bind everything together. Define what happens on failure (nothing, accidental result, catastrophe). Establish the training structure: apprenticeship or schools, curriculum, ranks, tests for advancement.

**What it produces:** Spell Design Templates and a Magic Training and Society Template.

**Templates needed:**
- Spell Design Template
- Magic Training and Society Template

**Dependencies:** Step 37 (magic rules must exist before creating spells).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 6 -- Magic Systems

---

### Step 39: Create Significant Items (Magic, Technological, and Regular)

**What you do:** Design at least one item in each relevant category (magic, technological, regular). For magic items: limit to 1-2 related powers per item, define defects and limitations, and connect the item to your magic system rules. For tech items: establish manufacturer reputations and species-based quality differences. For regular items: significance comes from association with people or events, not inherent properties. Define who can use each item and how it was created.

**What it produces:** Completed Item Profiles, Magic Item Detail Sheets, and Technological Item Detail Sheets.

**Templates needed:**
- Item Profile Template
- Magic Item Detail Sheet
- Technological Item Detail Sheet
- A.I. Profile Template (if SF setting)

**Dependencies:** Steps 37-38 (magic system rules govern magic items), Step 25 (sovereign power laws about item possession), Step 7 (gods for divine-origin items).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 7 -- Items

---

## Phase 8: HISTORY & LEGEND

*"Your world exists in the present. Now give it a past."*

---

### Step 40: Create Your Time System

**What you do:** Define how time is measured. Keep minutes and hours Earth-like (different lengths confuse without payoff). Change weeks (try 6 or 8 days), months (try 11 or 13), and year length if desired. Name the days and months (use a suffix like "-mon" for recognition). Create a universal calendar anchored to a globally recognized event (birth of magic, a cataclysm, a mass exodus). Define named ages (Stone Age, Elven Age, etc.).

**What it produces:** A completed Time System Template.

**Templates needed:**
- Time System Template

**Dependencies:** Step 10 (planetary data determines actual year length), Step 7 (gods and events for day/month naming), Steps 25-34 (civilization must exist for calendar-anchoring events to make sense).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 10 -- Creating Time and History

---

### Step 41: Write World History

**What you do:** Brainstorm at least 5-10 historical events using the category checklist: God interference, technological events, supernatural events, rise and fall of powers, wars, groups forming, artifacts discovered, and missions undertaken. Write each as a summary (date, title, one paragraph). Cross-file everything: when you create a history item, update the related sovereign power, item, creature, or land feature file.

**What it produces:** At least 5-10 History Entry Templates and entries in the World History Timeline.

**Templates needed:**
- History Entry Template
- World History Timeline

**Dependencies:** Step 40 (calendar system for dating events), Steps 25-39 (civilization and supernatural elements provide content for history).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 10 -- Creating Time and History

---

### Step 42: Create World Figures (Heroes, Villains, Martyrs)

**What you do:** Design the famous people of your world -- the "Elvis, Hitler, Jesus Christ" equivalents. These are cultural reference points, not necessarily story characters. For each, define: why they are famous (deeds, not just traits), what people believe versus what is true, their status (alive, dead, missing, imprisoned), at least one signature deed, 1-2 notable possessions with their own mini-histories, and how different species view them.

**What it produces:** At least 2-3 completed World Figure Profiles (one hero, one villain minimum).

**Templates needed:**
- World Figure Profile Template

**Dependencies:** Steps 7-9 (gods for divine connections), Steps 16-21 (species for multi-species perception), Steps 25-26 (sovereign powers and cultures for context), Step 41 (history events to connect figures to).

**Source:** Volume 1, Chapter 4 -- Creating World Figures

---

## Phase 9: LANGUAGE & NAMES

*"Everything exists. Now name it all."*

---

### Step 43: Decide Your Language Approach

**What you do:** Decide whether you will ignore constructed languages entirely, make up phrases as needed, create a naming language, hire a professional, or build a full language. The medium matters: film and TV benefit most from conlangs; print fiction least. A naming language (minimum useful level) can be obtained from the Language Creation Society for as little as $100.

**What it produces:** A completed Language Decision Worksheet.

**Templates needed:**
- Language Decision Worksheet

**Dependencies:** Step 26 (cultural vision affects language tone), Steps 16-20 (species need distinct language styles).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 8 -- Languages

---

### Step 44: Establish Naming Conventions by Culture

**What you do:** For each sovereign power or culture, define naming conventions: given name or surname first? How many names do people typically have? What common suffixes and prefixes are used? What triggers name changes (coming of age, marriage, gaining magic)? What are the compound surname rules? This creates cultural consistency when you name characters and places.

**What it produces:** A Naming Convention Sheet per culture and a blank Name Registry.

**Templates needed:**
- Naming Convention Sheet
- Name Registry

**Dependencies:** Step 43 (language approach informs naming style), Step 26 (cultural vision).

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 9 -- Names

---

### Step 45: Name Everything

**What you do:** Using your naming conventions and techniques (suffix/prefix addition, vowel substitution, compound words, silent letters, foreign language adaptation), name all people, places, and things in your world. Keep names to 1-3 syllables. Avoid same-first-letter names in the same story. Say names aloud. Google invented words to check for embarrassing meanings. Track everything in your Name Registry.

**What it produces:** A populated Name Registry and Place Name Worksheet. Names assigned to all gods, species, sovereign powers, settlements, land features, organizations, items, and characters.

**Templates needed:**
- Name Registry
- Place Name Worksheet
- Name Generation Checklist

**Dependencies:** Step 44 (naming conventions must exist first). Requires all prior steps to have produced the things that need naming.

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 9 -- Names

---

## Phase 10: TRAVEL & SCALE

*"How big is your world, and how long does it take to cross it?"*

These steps can be done in parallel with each other.

---

### Step 46: Calculate Land Travel Times

**What you do:** Set your map scale (e.g., 0.25 inches = 20 miles). Measure distances between key settlements. Break each route into terrain types (road, plains, light forest, heavy forest, hills, mountains, desert, swamp). Apply terrain modifiers to the base speed for each travel mode (walking: 12 miles/day; riding: 35 miles/day; wagon: 18 miles/day). Record the results. "Not drawn to scale" on maps provides leeway.

**What it produces:** A Travel Distance Reference and Land Travel Calculator.

**Templates needed:**
- Land Travel Calculator Template
- Travel Distance Reference

**Dependencies:** Steps 12-15 (continent and land features), Steps 29-30 (settlement locations).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 47-48.

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 7 -- Travel Over Land

---

### Step 47: Calculate Sea Travel Times

**What you do:** Identify key sea routes and measure distances. Convert to nautical miles (divide land miles by 1.151). Apply ship speeds (4-6 knots open ocean, 3-4 knots coastal). Coastal journeys lose about 8 hours per overnight stop. Decide on ship types for each naval power. If your world lacks gunpowder, the ballista is the best cannon replacement.

**What it produces:** Sea Travel Calculator entries, Ship Profile Templates, and a Naval Forces Summary.

**Templates needed:**
- Sea Travel Calculator Template
- Ship Profile Template
- Naval Forces Summary

**Dependencies:** Step 10 (wind and currents), Steps 12-15 (coastlines and straits), Step 25 (sovereign powers for naval capabilities), Steps 29-30 (port settlements).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 46, 48.

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 8 -- Travel by Water

---

### Step 48: Define Space Travel (If Applicable)

**What you do:** For science fiction settings: decide on propulsion types (STL, and which FTL type -- jump drive, hyper drive, or warp drive). Set limits on FTL travel (jump drives should be severely limited to preserve story conflict). Design at least one key spacecraft with internal structure notes. Establish consistency rules for your setting's technology level.

**What it produces:** Spacecraft Profile Templates and a Space Travel Reference.

**Templates needed:**
- Spacecraft Profile Template
- Space Travel Reference

**Dependencies:** Step 10 (solar system), Step 25 (spacefaring powers).

**Can be done in parallel with:** Steps 46, 47.

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 9 -- Travel in Space

---

## Phase 11: FINISHING TOUCHES

*"Bring the world to life with maps, adventure locations, and the details that make it feel real."*

---

### Step 49: Create Places of Interest

**What you do:** Design at least 3-5 noteworthy locations across different types: ruins with mysteries, phenomena (magic dead zones, portals, supercharged areas), shipwrecks, event sites (famous battles, religious sites), monuments, catacombs, or extraordinary places (underwater cities, floating settlements). The story associated with a place is what makes it interesting, not the place itself. Cross-reference each to your history timeline and relevant sovereign powers.

**What it produces:** Completed Place of Interest Profiles, Shipwreck Profiles (if applicable), and Phenomenon Catalog entries.

**Templates needed:**
- Place of Interest Profile Template
- Shipwreck Profile Template
- Phenomenon Catalog

**Dependencies:** Steps 12-15 (land features for locations), Steps 25-30 (sovereign powers and settlements), Step 41 (history for connected events), Steps 35-39 (supernatural elements for phenomena).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 11 -- Creating Places of Interest

---

### Step 50: Draw Maps

**What you do:** Create at least one continental map (even a rough sketch) following this workflow: coastline, latitude/hemisphere, mountains, rain shadows, rivers, settlements, vegetation, roads, sovereign power boundaries. Add "Not drawn to scale" to any shared maps. Optionally create settlement maps (water first, then Old Town, then expand outward). You do not need to be an artist -- software like Campaign Cartographer places pre-made icons.

**What it produces:** A continental map, optionally settlement maps. Map scale documented.

**Templates needed:**
- Map Creation Checklist -- Continental
- Map Creation Checklist -- Settlement

**Dependencies:** All of Phase 3 (land), Steps 25-30 (nations and settlements), Steps 46-47 (scale).

**Source:** Volume 2, Chapter 12 -- Drawing Maps

---

## Phase 12: INTEGRATION

*"The world is built. Now make sure it holds together."*

---

### Step 51: Review and Cross-Reference All Files

**What you do:** Go through every file you have created. For each entry, check: Does this connect to at least one other file? Are there contradictions between files? When you update one file, update all related files ("looping"). Use spreadsheet overview tabs to see the big picture. Use the Case Studies approach from Volume 2, Chapter 1 -- pick a geographic feature and trace all its consequences (political, cultural, economic, military).

**What it produces:** A consistent, cross-referenced world with no contradictions.

**Templates needed:**
- Worldbuilding Review Schedule

**Dependencies:** All prior steps.

**Source:** Volume 3, Chapter 11 -- Conclusion; Volume 2, Chapter 1 -- Case Studies

---

### Step 52: Establish a Review Cycle

**What you do:** Set a review schedule (monthly or quarterly). World building is iterative -- you will revisit and refine over months and years. Use a "changes to make" file to capture ideas during writing without derailing your current work. Periodically review all files to maintain integration and catch inconsistencies.

**What it produces:** A documented review schedule and an ongoing "changes to make" file.

**Templates needed:**
- Worldbuilding Review Schedule

**Dependencies:** Step 51 (first review must be completed).
