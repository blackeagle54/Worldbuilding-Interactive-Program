## 1. WORLD OVERVIEW

### Setting Summary
The Wheel of Time is set in a world without a commonly used name (fans often
call it "Randland"), a single planet with multiple continents and a rich,
layered history stretching back through repeating cycles called Ages. The
primary action takes place in the Westlands (also called "the wetlands" by
the Aiel), a region of roughly two dozen nations occupying a landmass west of
a great mountain range. The world also includes the Aiel Waste, the Seanchan
continent across the western ocean, the Sharan continent to the east, and the
desolate northern region known as the Blight, where the Dark One's influence
corrupts the land.

### Scope
- **Temporal**: The cosmology is infinite — the Wheel turns through seven
  Ages that repeat endlessly. Recorded history covers roughly 3,400 years
  (the current Third Age). The previous Age (the Age of Legends) is
  remembered in myth. Earlier Ages are lost entirely.
- **Spatial**: A full planet, with at least four major landmasses, diverse
  climates, and a parallel spirit-world (Tel'aran'rhiod, the World of
  Dreams). Additional parallel realities are accessible through Portal Stones.
- **Human Scale**: The story follows hundreds of characters across dozens of
  nations, armies, and organizations. The scope is epic — continental wars,
  clashes of civilizations, and the fate of reality itself.

### Genre & Tone
- **Genre**: Epic fantasy, heroic fantasy, with elements of mythology, military
  fiction, political intrigue, and romance.
- **Tone**: Grand, serious, richly detailed, deeply invested in character
  relationships and political maneuvering. Balances moments of wonder and
  beauty with brutal warfare, personal suffering, and moral complexity. The
  overall arc is hopeful — the Light can triumph, but the cost is always high.

### Core Philosophical Premise
The universe is meaningful. There is a Creator, a purpose to existence, and a
moral axis (Light vs. Shadow). However, the victory of good is never
guaranteed. Free will is real, and the Pattern (the fabric of reality woven by
the Wheel) can be influenced, disrupted, or broken. The central tension is
between destiny and choice — the Dragon Reborn is prophesied to save the world,
but the form that salvation takes depends on the choices of fallible human
beings.

## 2. COSMOLOGY & CREATION

### The Wheel of Time
The Wheel is the fundamental mechanism of reality. It has seven spokes, each
representing an Age. As the Wheel turns, it spins the Pattern — the fabric of
reality itself, woven from the threads of individual human lives. Each turning
of the Wheel through all seven Ages constitutes a complete cycle, after which
the Ages repeat. However, each repetition is not identical — the broad strokes
recur (the same archetypal events, the same key souls), but the details differ.

### The Pattern (The Great Pattern)
The Pattern is the total tapestry of all existence. Every person's life is a
thread in the Pattern. The Wheel weaves these threads according to its own
design, but individuals retain free will within the Pattern's constraints. Some
threads are more important — ta'veren (see below) are threads around which the
Pattern bends other threads, creating nexus points in reality.

### Ta'veren
Individuals who are focal points of the Pattern. When the Wheel needs to
correct the course of events, it creates ta'veren — people around whom chance
and probability warp. Near a ta'veren, unlikely events become common: lovers
reunite, enemies confess, buildings collapse, coins land on edge. The three
main protagonists (Rand, Mat, Perrin) are all ta'veren of exceptional strength.

### The True Source and the One Power
The energy that drives the Wheel is the True Source, which is divided into two
complementary halves: saidin (the male half) and saidar (the female half).
Together, they turn the Wheel and maintain the Pattern. This duality is
represented by the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai — a divided circle similar
to the yin-yang symbol, often called the Dragon's Fang (the black half) and
the Flame of Tar Valon (the white half).

### The Creator
The being who created the Wheel, the world, and the prison of the Dark One.
The Creator does not intervene in the world. Having set the Wheel in motion,
the Creator is absent — present as the ground of existence but not as an
active force. "I will not take part. Only the chosen one can do what must be
done, if he will." This single line (if it is even from the Creator) is the
only direct communication attributed to the Creator in the entire series.

### The Dark One (Shai'tan)
The antithesis of the Creator. Imprisoned outside the Pattern in a prison at
Shayol Ghul since the moment of creation. The Dark One seeks to break free,
destroy the Wheel, unmake the Pattern, and remake reality in its own image —
or simply end all existence. The Dark One is not the "devil" in a Christian
sense — it is a fundamental cosmic force of entropy, negation, and dissolution.
It can touch the world through the thinness of its prison, especially at
Shayol Ghul, granting power to its servants and corrupting the land.

### The Bore
During the Age of Legends, researchers drilling into the True Source
inadvertently opened a Bore — a thin spot in the Dark One's prison. This
allowed the Dark One to touch the world again, beginning the War of Power
and ultimately leading to the Breaking of the World.

### Tel'aran'rhiod (The World of Dreams)
A parallel reality that reflects the waking world but is shaped by thought
and will. The World of Dreams is the space between realities — all possible
worlds connect through it. Dreamwalkers (certain Aiel Wise Women and others)
can enter it deliberately. The dead pass through it briefly. Objects and
places in Tel'aran'rhiod mirror the waking world but change slowly, reflecting
the most permanent and enduring features. A skilled dreamwalker can alter
reality within the dream, create objects, change their appearance, or travel
instantly between locations.

### Parallel Worlds (Mirror Worlds)
Accessible through Portal Stones, these are alternate realities where history
diverged at key points. Some are recognizably similar to the main world;
others are radically different. They demonstrate that the Pattern is not
singular but one of many possible weavings.

## 3. PANTHEON / HIGHER POWERS

### The Creator
- Created the Wheel, the world, and imprisoned the Dark One.
- Does not intervene. The world must save itself.
- Not worshipped through organized religion in most cultures, but
  acknowledged as the source of the Light.

### The Dark One (Shai'tan)
- Also called: The Great Lord of the Dark (by his followers), Father of Lies,
  Shepherd of the Night, Lord of the Grave, the Great Lord.
- His true name (Shai'tan) is considered dangerous to speak — his followers
  fear that saying it draws his attention, and even the Light-aligned
  consider it imprudent.
- Can grant immortality (the Forsaken), resurrect the dead into new bodies
  (transmigration), and warp the natural world (the Blight).
- His ultimate goal is debated: destruction of the Pattern, remaking reality,
  or simply freedom. At Shayol Ghul, his influence manifests as oppressive
  heat, corruption of living things, and a pervasive sense of malice.

### The Forsaken (The Chosen)
Thirteen powerful channelers from the Age of Legends who swore allegiance to
the Dark One. They were sealed with the Dark One when Lews Therin and the
Hundred Companions sealed the Bore. They were freed when the seals weakened
in the Third Age.

- **Ishamael / Ba'alzamon / Moridin**: The most powerful and philosophical
  of the Forsaken. He believes the Dark One must inevitably win because the
  Wheel turns infinitely and the Dark One need only win once. Serves as
  Nae'blis (the Dark One's regent). Reborn as Moridin after death.
- **Lanfear / Cyndane**: The most powerful female channeler ever. Originally
  Mierin Eronaile, she helped drill the Bore. Obsessed with Lews Therin /
  Rand al'Thor. Her name means "Daughter of the Night."
- **Demandred**: A brilliant general who resented always being second to Lews
  Therin. Commands armies at the Last Battle.
- **Sammael**: A military commander who ruled Illian in the Third Age. Killed
  by Mashadar in Shadar Logoth.
- **Rahvin**: A manipulator who controlled Andor through Queen Morgase.
  Killed by Rand with balefire.
- **Be'lal**: The Envious. Killed by Moiraine with balefire.
- **Graendal / Hessalam**: A hedonist and master of Compulsion. Expert at
  psychological manipulation.
- **Semirhage**: A sadist and healer. Once the greatest Restorer (healer) in
  the Age of Legends, she turned to torture.
- **Mesaana**: Infiltrated the White Tower disguised as an Aes Sedai. Sought
  to control the Tower from within.
- **Moghedien**: The Spider. Operates through manipulation and espionage
  rather than direct confrontation. Expert in Tel'aran'rhiod.
- **Aginor / Osan'gar / Dashiva**: A biologist who created Trollocs,
  Myrddraal, and other Shadowspawn. Reborn as Osan'gar.
- **Balthamel / Aran'gar / Halima**: Reborn in a female body. Infiltrated
  the rebel Aes Sedai camp.
- **Asmodean**: A musician. Briefly served as Rand's teacher in channeling
  before being killed.

### The Heroes of the Horn
Legendary heroes bound to the Wheel who are reborn in every Age when needed.
Between lives, they reside in Tel'aran'rhiod. They can be summoned by the
Horn of Valere to fight in the world's hour of greatest need. Known Heroes
include Artur Hawkwing, Birgitte Silverbow (who was ripped out of the dream
and lives in the current Age), and Gaidal Cain.

---

## 4. RACES & SPECIES

### Humans
The dominant and essentially sole sentient race in the Wheel of Time. Unlike
many fantasy settings, there are no elves, dwarves, or other classic fantasy
races. Humans exhibit enormous cultural diversity (see Cultures & Societies)
but are biologically one species. Channelers (those who can use the One Power)
are human — channeling is a genetic ability, not a racial distinction.

### Ogier
- **Appearance**: Large (roughly eight to ten feet tall), broad, with wide
  noses, tufted ears, and long eyebrows. Gentle demeanor.
- **Nature**: Long-lived (centuries). Thoughtful, deliberate, slow to anger
  but devastating when roused ("When the Ogier march to war, the earth
  trembles").
- **Culture**: Live in stedding — pockets of land where the One Power cannot
  be accessed and where Shadowspawn cannot enter comfortably. Master
  stonemasons and woodworkers. They sing to trees (Treesinging) to shape
  living wood. Built many of the great human cities.
- **The Longing**: Ogier who remain outside a stedding for too long sicken
  and eventually die. This keeps them tied to their homes.
- **Seanchan Ogier**: A separate population of Ogier on the Seanchan
  continent who serve as fierce warriors — the Gardeners — a sharp
  contrast to their scholarly Westland cousins.

### Aelfinn and Eelfinn
- **The Aelfinn** (Snaky Folk): Accessed through a twisted redstone doorframe
  ter'angreal. They answer three questions truthfully, though the answers
  are often cryptically phrased. They feed on human emotion and experience.
- **The Eelfinn** (Foxy Folk): Accessed through a different doorframe. They
  grant three wishes, but always exact a price. They exist in a realm
  connected to but separate from the normal world, accessible through the
  Tower of Ghenjei.
- **Nature**: Both are non-human intelligences from another dimension. They
  are bound by their own rules. Iron, music, and fire are weapons against
  them.

### Nym
- Constructs from the Age of Legends. Plant-like beings created to assist
  with agriculture. They performed the "seed singing" alongside Ogier and
  human channelers to ensure bountiful harvests. The Green Man (Someshta)
  was the last surviving Nym.

### Wolves
- Not a "race" in the political sense, but wolves in the Wheel of Time are
  sapient. They have their own society, memories that pass through
  generations (they remember the Trolloc Wars), and a deep connection to
  Tel'aran'rhiod. Wolfbrothers — humans who can communicate with wolves and
  enter the Dream — share a bond with them. Wolves call the Dark One "the
  Eyeless" and the Last Battle "the Last Hunt."

## 5. MAGIC SYSTEMS

### The One Power
The magic system of the Wheel of Time is one of the most detailed and
internally consistent in all of fantasy literature.

### The True Source
The True Source is the driving force of the universe, divided into:
- **Saidin**: The male half. Described as a raging torrent — wild, powerful,
  requiring force and will to control. The channeler must seize it and ride
  it. Until cleansed by Rand, saidin was tainted by the Dark One's
  counterstroke at the sealing of the Bore, causing any man who channeled
  to eventually go mad and rot alive.
- **Saidar**: The female half. Described as a flowing river — the channeler
  must surrender to it, guide it gently, not fight it. Saidar was not
  tainted.
- Men cannot sense saidar being channeled, and women cannot sense saidin,
  though both can sense the effects.

### Channeling
The act of drawing on the True Source and directing it. A channeler draws in
the Power, then weaves it into specific patterns (called weaves or flows)
using the Five Powers:

1. **Earth**: Control over earth, stone, metal. Traditionally stronger in men.
2. **Water**: Control over water and ice.
3. **Air**: Control over air, wind, and atmospheric pressure.
4. **Fire**: Control over heat, flame, and light. Traditionally stronger in men.
5. **Spirit**: The most esoteric Power. Affects the mind, dreams, the fabric
   of the Pattern. Used for Healing, warding, shielding, bonding.

Most weaves combine two or more of the Five Powers. For example:
- A fireball might combine Fire and Air.
- Healing uses all five Powers.
- A gateway (for Traveling) uses Spirit primarily.

### Strength and Skill
- Channelers vary enormously in raw strength (how much of the Power they
  can hold). Strength has a genetic component and is roughly fixed.
- Skill and knowledge matter as much or more than raw strength. A weaker
  channeler who knows the right weave can defeat a stronger one who does not.
- Some channelers have Talents — special aptitudes for particular kinds of
  channeling (Healing, Making ter'angreal, Dreaming, Foretelling, etc.).

### Linking (Circles)
Multiple channelers can combine their power by forming a circle (or link).
Rules govern circles:
- Up to 13 women can link without a man.
- To go beyond 13, or for certain configurations, men must be included.
- The maximum circle is 72 (36 men and 36 women).
- One person directs the circle and controls all the combined power.

### Key Techniques and Abilities
- **Traveling**: Creating a gateway — a hole in the Pattern — that connects
  two distant locations. Requires knowledge of the starting point (for
  saidin) or destination (for saidar).
- **Healing**: Mending injuries and curing illness using the One Power.
  Ranges from basic to miraculous (Nynaeve Healed stilling/gentling).
- **Compulsion**: Forcing another person's will. Ethically forbidden but
  devastatingly effective. Graendal's specialty.
- **Balefire**: A beam of pure destruction that burns a target out of the
  Pattern retroactively — undoing their recent actions. Extremely dangerous
  because it damages the Pattern itself. Both sides banned it during the
  War of Power because overuse threatened to unravel reality.
- **Shielding and Stilling/Gentling**: A channeler can be cut off from the
  Source temporarily (shielding) or permanently (stilling for women,
  gentling for men). Permanent severing was considered irreversible until
  Nynaeve discovered how to Heal it.
- **Dreaming**: Entering Tel'aran'rhiod deliberately. Not all channelers can
  do this — it is a specific Talent.
- **Foretelling**: Spontaneous prophecy. Rare and uncontrollable.
- **Warder Bond**: Aes Sedai bond Warders — warriors who gain enhanced
  stamina, senses, and healing in exchange for a psychic link.

### The Taint on Saidin
The Dark One's counterstroke when Lews Therin sealed the Bore coated saidin
in a film of corruption. Any man who channeled saidin would slowly go mad
and eventually die of a wasting sickness. This caused the Breaking of the
World and led to three thousand years of fear and persecution of male
channelers. Rand al'Thor cleansed saidin using the Choedan Kal and the
evil of Shadar Logoth as a buffer.

### The True Power
A separate, far more dangerous source of energy: the essence of the Dark One
itself. Only the Dark One's most favored servants are given access. Using it
is addictive, produces saa (dark flecks in the eyes), and ultimately destroys
the user. Ishamael/Moridin used it extensively. Rand accessed it once in
desperation, to escape a trap.

## 6. GEOGRAPHY & PLACES

### The Westlands (The Main Continent)

#### Nations (Selected)
- **Andor**: The most prominent kingdom. Capital: Caemlyn. Ruled by a Queen
  (the Lion Throne). Powerful, central, traditional. Rand's birthplace
  (raised in the Two Rivers, part of Andor). Elayne Trakand becomes Queen.
- **Cairhien**: A nation obsessed with political intrigue (Daes Dae'mar, the
  Game of Houses). Capital: Cairhien. Small in territory, powerful in
  influence.
- **Illian**: A merchant nation. Capital: Illian. Ruled by a King and a
  council. Home of the Hunt for the Horn.
- **Tear**: Wealthy from trade. Capital: the Stone of Tear, a massive
  fortress built during the Trolloc Wars. The People of the Dragon are
  prophesied to take the Stone.
- **Arad Doman**: A nation of merchants and diplomats. Women are noted for
  their assertiveness in courtship.
- **Tarabon**: Politically unstable, known for veiled women and political chaos.
- **Altara**: Contains Ebou Dar, a major port city with a distinct knife-
  carrying culture. The Kin (non-Tower channelers) are based here.
- **Murandy**: Weak, fractious, a buffer state.
- **Ghealdan**: Small nation where the Prophet Masema caused chaos.
- **Amadicia**: Dominated by the Children of the Light. Capital: Amador.
- **Far Madding**: An independent city built over a ter'angreal that blocks
  channeling. A matriarchal trade center.
- **Mayene**: A tiny, wealthy city-state that survives through diplomacy.
- **Borderlands**: Shienar, Arafel, Kandor, and Saldaea. The four nations
  that border the Blight. Warrior cultures dedicated to holding the line
  against Shadowspawn.

#### The Two Rivers
A rural district in western Andor, so isolated its people have forgotten they
are part of any nation. Home of Rand al'Thor, Mat Cauthon, Perrin Aybara,
Egwene al'Vere, and Nynaeve al'Meara. The blood of ancient Manetheren runs
strong here.

### Key Cities and Structures

#### Tar Valon
An island city in the River Erinin, built by Ogier. Home of the White Tower,
the seat of the Aes Sedai. The most impressive city in the Westlands.
Beautiful, well-governed, and central to the political landscape.

#### The White Tower
The headquarters of the Aes Sedai. A massive structure of white stone,
roughly 600 feet tall. Contains the Hall of the Tower (the governing body),
the Amyrlin's study, and quarters for Aes Sedai, Accepted, and Novices.

#### The Stone of Tear
One of the oldest fortifications in the world. Never fallen to siege until
Rand al'Thor entered it to claim Callandor.

#### Shayol Ghul
A mountain in the Blasted Lands north of the Blight. The thinnest point in
the Dark One's prison. A place of perpetual volcanic activity, choking fumes,
and overwhelming evil. The site of the Last Battle's climactic confrontation.

### Beyond the Westlands

#### The Aiel Waste
A vast desert east of the Spine of the World mountains. Homeland of the Aiel.
Harsh, dry, with hidden water sources and canyon strongholds called holds.
The city of Rhuidean, containing ter'angreal that reveal the Aiel's true
history, sits at its heart.

#### Seanchan
A continent across the Aryth Ocean, conquered and unified by the descendants
of Artur Hawkwing's armies. The Seanchan have a rigid, hierarchical society,
use enslaved channelers (damane), and ride exotic creatures. They invade the
Westlands during the series.

#### Shara
A mysterious continent east of the Aiel Waste. Reclusive and little known.
Ruled by channelers. Demandred secretly conquers Shara and brings its armies
to the Last Battle.

#### The Land of Madmen
A southern continent populated by channelers driven mad, where civilization
has never stabilized. Barely mentioned in the main series.

### Metaphysical Places

#### Tel'aran'rhiod
The World of Dreams (see Cosmology). A parallel dimension reflecting the
waking world, shaped by willpower.

#### The Ways
Paths between locations, originally grown from the One Power as a gift to
the Ogier. Once beautiful and safe, now corrupted and dark, haunted by
Machin Shin (the Black Wind), a lethal entity of unknown origin.

#### Portal Stone Worlds
Alternate realities accessible through ancient standing stones.

## 7. POLITICAL SYSTEMS

### The Aes Sedai and the White Tower
The most powerful political institution in the Westlands.

- **Structure**: Led by the Amyrlin Seat (equivalent to a queen or pope),
  chosen by the Hall of the Tower (representatives from each Ajah).
  Advised by the Keeper of the Chronicles.
- **The Seven Ajahs**: Blue (causes and justice), Red (hunting male
  channelers), Green (Battle Ajah, ready for the Last Battle), Yellow
  (Healing), White (logic and philosophy), Brown (knowledge and history),
  Gray (mediation and diplomacy).
- **The Black Ajah**: A secret society of Darkfriend Aes Sedai, hidden
  within the Tower. Its existence was denied for millennia.
- **Power**: Aes Sedai advise rulers, mediate disputes, and command
  enormous respect and fear. They are bound by the Three Oaths (sworn
  on the Oath Rod): to speak no word that is not true, to make no weapon
  for one man to kill another, and to never use the One Power as a weapon
  except against Shadowspawn or in defense of her life or that of her
  Warder or another Aes Sedai.
- **Weakness**: Arrogance, insularity, internal politics, and a declining
  population of channelers have weakened the Tower over the millennia.

### The Children of the Light (Whitecloaks)
A militant organization devoted to fighting the Shadow. In practice, they
are fanatical, intolerant, and often corrupt. They consider all channelers
to be Darkfriends. Based in Amadicia but operate across the Westlands.
The Hand of the Light (Questioners) use torture to extract confessions.

### The Seanchan Empire
- **Structure**: An absolute monarchy under the Empress (or Emperor). The
  Crystal Throne is the seat of power. Incredibly rigid social hierarchy
  including hereditary nobles (the Blood), a complex bureaucracy, and
  slaves (da'covale).
- **Damane System**: Female channelers (damane, "leashed ones") are enslaved
  using a ter'angreal called an a'dam, controlled by sul'dam ("leash
  holders"). The Seanchan consider uncontrolled channelers an abomination.
- **Military**: Highly disciplined. Uses exotic animals: raken and to'raken
  (flying reptiles), lopar, torm, and s'redit (elephants) as war beasts.
- **Omens**: Seanchan culture is deeply superstitious, guided by omens and
  portents that the Empress interprets.

### Nation-States of the Westlands
Most are monarchies of varying types:
- Andor: Hereditary queen, with strong noble houses.
- Cairhien: Hereditary king or queen, but effectively ruled by the Game
  of Houses (constant political maneuvering among noble houses).
- Tear: High Lords rule collectively (an oligarchy).
- Illian: King balanced by a Council of Nine and the Assemblage.
- Borderland nations: Monarchies with strong martial cultures.

### The Aiel
Governed by clan chiefs (political/military leaders) and Wise Ones (female
channelers and advisors who hold enormous authority). There are twelve clans
and numerous warrior societies (see Cultures). The Aiel have no concept of
hereditary nobility.

### Darkfriend Networks
Followers of the Dark One exist at all levels of every society. They form
a shadow government — an invisible web of agents, informants, and saboteurs.
Their ultimate commanders are the Forsaken.

## 8. HISTORY & TIMELINE

### The Ages (Overview)
The Wheel has seven Ages. Only three are described in any detail:

### The Age of Legends (Second Age)
- A utopian era of advanced civilization. Channelers (both men and women,
  called Aes Sedai) worked together openly. Technology powered by the
  One Power reached heights never since matched: flying vehicles, instant
  communication, medical science that could extend life enormously.
- The Bore was drilled by Mierin Eronaile and Beidomon, researchers seeking
  a new power source. They inadvertently opened a hole in the Dark One's
  prison.
- The Dark One's influence spread slowly — the "collapse" of society
  happened over decades. Crime, violence, and despair increased. The
  Forsaken turned to the Shadow.
- The War of Power (also called the War of the Shadow): A global
  conflict between the Shadow's forces and the free peoples.
- The Strike at Shayol Ghul: Lews Therin Telamon (the Dragon) led the
  Hundred Companions (all male channelers) to seal the Bore with seven
  seals of cuendillar. The Dark One's counterstroke tainted saidin.
- The Breaking of the World: The male Aes Sedai went mad. Their
  uncontrolled channeling reshaped the planet — mountains rose, seas
  drained, continents shifted. Civilization was destroyed. The Breaking
  lasted approximately 300 years.

### The Third Age (The Current Age)
Major events in chronological order:

#### The Compact of the Ten Nations (~200 AB)
- After the Breaking, ten nations formed an alliance to resist the Shadow.
  This era is remembered as a relative golden age.

#### The Trolloc Wars (~1000-1350 AB)
- Massive invasions of Shadowspawn from the Blight, coordinated by
  Darkfriends and possibly freed Forsaken. The Ten Nations were destroyed
  one by one. Manetheren famously fell in a heroic last stand. The wars
  lasted roughly 350 years and reshaped the political map entirely.

#### The Free Years (~1350-1600 AB)
- Recovery and rebuilding. New nations formed. The White Tower was built.

#### Artur Hawkwing's Empire (~FY 943-994)
- Artur Paendrag Tanreall united all the Westlands under one rule. A
  brilliant general and administrator, but he turned against the Aes
  Sedai (influenced by Ishamael). He sent armies across the Aryth Ocean
  (founding the Seanchan Empire) and besieged Tar Valon. His death
  without a clear heir led to the War of the Hundred Years.

#### The War of the Hundred Years (~FY 994-1117)
- Civil war that shattered Hawkwing's empire into the modern nations.

#### The Aiel War (976-978 NE)
- Four clans of Aiel crossed the Spine of the World to punish the
  Cairhienin king who had cut down Avendoraldera, a gift from the Aiel.
  The Aiel sacked Cairhien and fought the gathered armies of the
  Westlands to a standstill at the Battle of the Shining Walls (outside
  Tar Valon) before returning home.

#### The Main Series Events (~998-1000 NE)
- The Dragon Reborn (Rand al'Thor) is identified. The Forsaken are freed.
  Seanchan invade. The White Tower splits. Rand cleanses saidin. The
  nations are united (barely) for Tarmon Gai'don — the Last Battle —
  which takes place at Shayol Ghul and across the Westlands. The Dark
  One is re-imprisoned. The Third Age ends; the Fourth Age begins.

---

## 9. KEY CHARACTERS & FIGURES

### The Dragon Reborn and His Circle

#### Rand al'Thor (The Dragon Reborn)
- The central protagonist. A shepherd from the Two Rivers who is the
  reincarnation of Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon. Prophesied to save
  the world and break it again. Channels saidin, fights the taint's
  madness, struggles with the weight of destiny, and ultimately reseals
  the Dark One's prison at the Last Battle. His character arc is about
  learning that strength without compassion is tyranny, and that saving
  the world requires caring about it.

#### Mat Cauthon
- Rand's friend from the Two Rivers. A gambler, trickster, and reluctant
  hero. Carries memories from past lives (a gift/curse from the Eelfinn).
  Becomes the greatest general of the age. Married to Tuon (Fortuona),
  Empress of the Seanchan. Blows the Horn of Valere at the Last Battle.

#### Perrin Aybara
- Rand's friend. A blacksmith and wolfbrother who can communicate with
  wolves and enter the World of Dreams. Struggles with his own capacity
  for violence. Becomes Lord of the Two Rivers. His arc is about
  accepting responsibility and his dual nature.

#### Egwene al'Vere
- From the Two Rivers. Becomes one of the most powerful Aes Sedai in
  history and is raised as the youngest Amyrlin Seat. Reunifies the
  Tower. Dies at the Last Battle using a weave that counters balefire,
  sealing cracks in the Pattern. Her arc embodies duty and sacrifice.

#### Nynaeve al'Meara
- The Two Rivers' Wisdom (healer). Enormously powerful channeler who
  initially can only channel when angry. Heals stilling and gentling —
  previously thought impossible. Becomes Aes Sedai. Married to Lan.
  Represents fierce loyalty and the refusal to accept the impossible.

#### Moiraine Damodred
- An Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah who has spent twenty years searching
  for the Dragon Reborn. Guides the young heroes from the Two Rivers.
  Sacrifices herself to stop Lanfear, is trapped in the Eelfinn realm,
  and is eventually rescued. Crucial at the Last Battle.

#### Lan Mandragoran (al'Lan Mandragoran)
- The uncrowned king of Malkier, a Borderland nation consumed by the
  Blight. Moiraine's Warder, later bonded to Nynaeve. The consummate
  warrior. Leads a seemingly suicidal charge into the Blight and
  survives to kill Demandred at the Last Battle.

### Other Major Characters

#### Elayne Trakand
- Daughter-Heir and later Queen of Andor. A powerful channeler. One of
  Rand's three romantic partners. Makes ter'angreal — a rare Talent.

#### Aviendha
- An Aiel Wise One. Warrior and channeler. One of Rand's partners.
  Sees a terrifying future for the Aiel and works to change it.

#### Min Farshaw
- A woman with the Talent of viewing images around people that reveal
  their futures. One of Rand's partners. Her viewings are always true.

#### Thom Merrilin
- A gleeman (traveling entertainer) and former court bard. A master of
  the Game of Houses, knife-thrower, and source of wisdom.

#### Loial
- An Ogier scholar. Gentle, bookish, incredibly strong. Provides comic
  relief and deep loyalty. Records the events of the series.

#### Siuan Sanche
- Former Amyrlin Seat, deposed and stilled, later Healed. A master
  political operator who works behind the scenes to prepare for the
  Last Battle.

#### Faile Bashere
- Perrin's wife. A Saldaean noblewoman. Fierce, proud, and politically
  astute.

#### Cadsuane Melaidhrin
- The oldest living Aes Sedai. Legendary and feared. Appointed herself
  Rand's advisor with the goal of teaching him to laugh and cry again.

## 10. CULTURES & SOCIETIES

### The Aiel
- **Environment**: Desert-dwelling warriors of the Aiel Waste.
- **Social Structure**: Twelve clans, each with multiple septs. Warrior
  societies (Far Dareis Mai / Maiden of the Spear, Stone Dogs, Thunder
  Walkers, etc.) cross clan boundaries. Wise Ones (channelers and
  advisors) hold authority parallel to clan chiefs.
- **Honor System** (ji'e'toh): An elaborate code of honor governing all
  behavior. Obligation (toh) is a central concept — debts of honor must
  be met. Touching someone in battle creates toh. Surrender is acceptable
  (gai'shain — a year of service in white).
- **Fighting Style**: Unarmored, using spears, bucklers, and bows. Expert
  ambushers and desert fighters. Considered the finest light infantry in
  the world.
- **Veil**: Aiel cover their faces when they intend to kill. Showing
  one's face means peace.
- **Secret History**: The Aiel were originally pacifist followers of the
  Way of the Leaf (Da'shain Aiel) who served the Aes Sedai during the
  Age of Legends. The truth of their origin is revealed through the
  ter'angreal columns in Rhuidean.
- **Humor**: Aiel have a complex sense of humor that outsiders rarely
  understand. They appreciate irony and absurdity.

### The Seanchan
- **Origin**: Descended from Artur Hawkwing's armies sent across the ocean.
- **Social Structure**: Extremely hierarchical. The Imperial Family at the
  top, then the Blood (nobility of varying degrees), then commoners, then
  da'covale (property/slaves). Social mobility exists but is rigidly
  structured.
- **Damane**: Channelers collared with a'dam. Treated as animals — valuable
  animals, but not people. This is the most disturbing aspect of Seanchan
  culture from a Westland perspective.
- **Military Excellence**: Highly disciplined, tactically sophisticated,
  and supplemented by exotic creatures and damane.
- **Justice**: The Seanchan legal system is harsh but consistent. Crime is
  low in Seanchan-held territory. They bring order and stability, which
  makes them attractive to commoners despite the slavery.

### Two Rivers Folk
- Rural, stubborn, independent. They have forgotten their heritage as
  the people of ancient Manetheren. Women's Circle and Village Council
  govern communally. Strong sense of community and practical morality.

### Cairhienin
- Practitioners of Daes Dae'mar (the Game of Houses). Every word and
  gesture has political meaning. Repressed, formal, and calculating.
  Short in stature. Their national character was shaped by the loss of
  the Aiel's gift (Avendoraldera) and the resulting Aiel War.

### Domani
- Merchant culture from Arad Doman. Women are trained in the arts of
  persuasion and seduction as a business tool. Men are master negotiators.

### Borderlanders
- The four Borderland nations (Shienar, Arafel, Kandor, Saldaea) live in
  constant readiness for Shadowspawn attacks. Martial cultures with
  strong codes of honor. Each has distinct traditions: Shienaran
  topknots, Arafellin bells in their braids, Saldaean boldness.

### The Sea Folk (Atha'an Miere)
- Seafaring people who live on their ships. Governed by the Mistress of
  the Ships and Wavemistresses. Skilled channelers (Windfinders) who
  specialize in weather control. Fiercely independent. Their Bargains
  (trade agreements) are legendarily favorable to themselves.

### The Tinkers (Tuatha'an)
- Traveling people who follow the Way of the Leaf — absolute pacifism.
  They search for a lost song from the Age of Legends. Brightly dressed,
  peaceful, and often persecuted. They are the closest descendants of the
  original Da'shain Aiel.

### The Kin
- A hidden organization of women who can channel but left or were put
  out of the White Tower. Based in Ebou Dar. Much older (in total
  membership age) than the Tower realizes. They prove that channelers
  can live far longer than Aes Sedai do (the Oath Rod shortens life).

---

## 11. ARTIFACTS & ITEMS

### Objects of the One Power

#### Angreal
- Objects that allow a channeler to draw more of the One Power than they
  safely could alone. Act as a buffer and amplifier. Invaluable and
  irreplaceable — the knowledge to create them was lost after the
  Breaking.

#### Sa'angreal
- Far more powerful versions of angreal. Allow access to enormous flows
  of the Power. The most powerful sa'angreal known are the Choedan Kal —
  two massive statues (one male, one female) that can channel enough
  power to crack the world. Rand and Nynaeve used them to cleanse saidin.

#### Ter'angreal
- Objects made with the One Power that perform specific functions.
  Enormously varied: the Oath Rod (binds oaths), the a'dam (controls
  channelers), the twisted redstone doorframes (access the Aelfinn and
  Eelfinn), the dream ter'angreal (access Tel'aran'rhiod), the columns
  of Rhuidean (reveal ancestral memories), and many more. Elayne has
  the rare Talent of creating new ter'angreal.

### Named Artifacts

#### Callandor (The Sword That Is Not a Sword)
- A crystal sa'angreal in the shape of a sword. Extremely powerful but
  flawed — it lacks the safety buffer of most sa'angreal and amplifies
  the taint. Must be used in a circle of three (one man, two women) to
  be wielded safely. Prophesied to be wielded by the Dragon Reborn.

#### The Horn of Valere
- A curved golden horn that, when blown, summons the Heroes of the Horn
  from Tel'aran'rhiod to fight. Only works for the one bound to it (Mat
  Cauthon, ultimately). Central to the Great Hunt.

#### The Ruby-Hilted Dagger (from Shadar Logoth)
- A dagger tainted by the evil of Shadar Logoth (Mashadar). Bonds to its
  bearer, enhances paranoia and hatred, and will eventually kill them. Mat
  was contaminated by it and had to be Healed by Aes Sedai.

#### The Dragon Banner and the Banner of the Light
- Banners that mark the Dragon Reborn's forces. The Dragon Banner bears
  the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai.

#### The Oath Rod
- A ter'angreal that makes sworn oaths physically unbreakable. Used by
  the Aes Sedai to enforce the Three Oaths. Also shortens the lifespan
  of those bound by it. Originally used in the Age of Legends to bind
  criminals.

#### Foxhead Medallion
- Mat's ter'angreal, given by the Eelfinn. Dissolves direct weaves of
  the One Power that touch it. Does not protect against indirect effects
  (a channeler throwing a rock, not a fireball).

#### The Seals on the Dark One's Prison
- Seven discs of cuendillar (heartstone, an indestructible substance)
  that focus the seal on the Dark One's prison. Over three thousand years,
  they have weakened and can now be broken. Their breaking is necessary
  for the Dragon to reseal the prison properly.

### Materials

#### Cuendillar (Heartstone)
- A substance that is theoretically indestructible. Absorbs the One Power
  directed against it and becomes stronger. The seals on the Dark One's
  prison are made of cuendillar.

#### Power-Wrought Weapons
- Weapons forged with the One Power. They never dull, never rust, and
  can kill Myrddraal and other Shadowspawn that are resistant to normal
  weapons. Lan's sword is power-wrought.

---

## 12. CREATURES & MONSTERS

### Shadowspawn
Creatures created by Aginor during the War of Power using the True Source
to twist existing life forms.

#### Trollocs
- The foot soldiers of the Shadow. Massive (seven to eight feet tall),
  bestial humanoids with a mix of human and animal features — ram horns,
  eagle beaks, boar snouts, wolf muzzles. Fierce but stupid, cowardly
  without leadership. Organized into bands with animal-derived names
  (Ahf'frait, Al'ghol, Bhan'sheen, etc.). Cannot cross running water
  easily. Eat human flesh.

#### Myrddraal (Fades, Halfmen, Eyeless)
- Throwbacks born among Trollocs — tall, pale, eyeless humanoids in
  black cloaks. Far more dangerous than Trollocs. They can see without
  eyes, move through shadows (appearing to step from one shadow to
  another), and their gaze inspires supernatural terror. They command
  Trollocs through a psychic link — killing a Myrddraal causes all
  Trollocs linked to it to go into a frenzy. Their blood is corrosive
  to weapons. They are extremely difficult to kill (they do not stop
  moving until sunset of the day they die).

#### Draghkar
- Flying creatures that resemble humans with bat wings. They sing to
  mesmerize victims, then consume their souls through a kiss. Used as
  scouts and assassins.

#### Gray Men (Soulless)
- Humans who voluntarily gave their souls to the Dark One. They become
  almost unnoticeable — the eye slides over them. Used as assassins.
  They are not truly Shadowspawn but shadow-servants.

#### Darkhounds
- Corrupted wolves, the size of ponies, that run in packs. Nearly
  impossible to kill — their saliva is lethal poison, and they reform
  unless destroyed by balefire. They track relentlessly.

#### Gholam
- Six were made during the War of Power. Virtually indestructible,
  shape-shifting assassins immune to the One Power. Only Mat's foxhead
  medallion can harm one. They consume blood.

#### Jumara (Worms)
- Enormous worm-like creatures in the Blight. Even Myrddraal avoid them.

#### Draghkar, Worms, and other Blight creatures
- The Blight is home to a vast ecology of corrupted life — twisted
  plants, insects, and animals, all dangerous. Even the vegetation can
  kill.

### Other Creatures

#### The Green Man (Someshta)
- The last Nym. A massive figure of living vegetation. Guarded the Eye
  of the World for millennia. Killed by Balthamel but destroyed him in
  return.

#### Machin Shin (The Black Wind)
- An entity that haunts the Ways. A wind made of whispers and souls.
  Contact with it strips the mind bare, leaving victims either dead or
  gibbering wrecks.

#### Slayer (Luc/Isam)
- A unique being: the fusion of Lord Luc Mantear (Rand's uncle) and
  Isam Mandragoran (Lan's cousin). Can shift between their appearances.
  Operates primarily in Tel'aran'rhiod as a hunter and assassin for the
  Shadow. Can enter and exit the Dream physically.

## 13. LANGUAGES & NAMING

### The Old Tongue
Robert Jordan created a functional constructed language, the Old Tongue,
which serves as the historical language of the Age of Legends and earlier
periods. It has consistent grammar, vocabulary, and phonological rules.

Key phrases and words:
- "Dovie'andi se tovya sagain" — "It's time to toss the dice" (Mat's motto).
- "Tai'shar Malkier / Manetheren" — "True blood of Malkier / Manetheren."
- "Carai an Caldazar! Carai an Ellisande!" — "For the honor of the Red
  Eagle! For the honor of the Rose of the Sun!" (Battle cry of Manetheren.)
- "Los! Los caba'donde ain!" — "Go! Go forward to glory!"
- "Aes Sedai" — "Servants of All."
- "Sa souvraya niende misain ye" — "I am lost in my own mind."
- "Tia mi aven Moridin isainde vadin" — "The grave is no bar to my call."

### Naming Conventions by Culture
Jordan was meticulous about giving each culture distinct naming patterns:

- **Two Rivers / Andor**: English-sounding names. Rand al'Thor, Mat Cauthon,
  Perrin Aybara, Egwene al'Vere. The "al'" prefix is common in the Two
  Rivers (similar to "son of" or "of the").
- **Aiel**: Distinctive, often short. Aviendha, Rhuarc, Amys, Bair, Sulin,
  Gaul. Clan and sept names are separate.
- **Cairhienin**: French-influenced. Moiraine Damodred, Barthanes Damodred,
  Colavaere Saighan.
- **Illian**: Includes distinctive speech patterns (replacing "my" with "me,"
  using "do" constructions). Bayle Domon, Mattin Stepaneos.
- **Tairen**: Spanish/Italian-influenced. Siuan Sanche, Darlin Sisnera.
- **Seanchan**: East Asian-influenced elements mixed with others. Tuon,
  Suroth, Karede, Musenge.
- **Borderlands**: Each nation has distinct patterns. Shienaran names sound
  Japanese-influenced (Agelmar, Ingtar); Saldaean names sound Persian
  (Davram Bashere, Faile, Tenobia).
- **Sea Folk**: Distinctive patterns. Harine din Togara Two Winds, Nesta
  din Reas Two Moons.
- **Ogier**: Soft, flowing names. Loial son of Arent son of Halan, Elder
  Haman, Erith.

### Prophecies and Formal Language
Jordan used a formal, archaic register for prophecies, creating a sense
of weight and inevitability:
"The Dragon shall be Reborn, and there will be wailing and gnashing of
teeth at his rebirth. In sackcloth and ashes shall he clothe the people,
and he shall break the world again by his coming, tearing apart all ties
that bind."

## 14. WORLDBUILDING TECHNIQUES

### What Makes Jordan's Worldbuilding Distinctive

#### 1. Cultural Depth and Diversity
Jordan's greatest strength. Every nation, every people, every community
has distinct customs, clothing, food, architecture, gender roles, political
structures, naming conventions, speech patterns, and worldviews. The Aiel
are not generic barbarians — they have a fully realized honor code, sense
of humor, social structure, and hidden history. The Seanchan are not generic
invaders — they have a complete civilization with its own internal logic,
virtues, and horrors.

#### 2. The Magic System as Science
The One Power is one of the most carefully constructed magic systems in
fantasy. It has rules, limitations, costs, and internal logic. Channelers
must learn specific weaves. Strength varies. The five elemental Powers
combine in specific ways. This systematic approach allows for magical
problem-solving, magical combat, and magical politics that feel grounded
and consistent.

#### 3. Gender as Worldbuilding Axis
The division of the One Power into saidin and saidar — and the taint on
saidin — creates a world where gender is a fundamental structural element.
For three thousand years, only women could safely channel, shaping politics,
religion, culture, and gender relations across every society. Jordan explores
how this asymmetry manifests differently in different cultures, from Aes
Sedai dominance in the Westlands to damane slavery in Seanchan.

#### 4. History as Living Force
The past is never dead in the Wheel of Time. Ancient blood runs in the Two
Rivers. The Aiel carry a forgotten history that defines their identity. The
Breaking of the World shaped the geography. The Trolloc Wars created the
Borderland cultures. Artur Hawkwing's empire created the Seanchan threat.
Every present-day conflict has roots stretching back centuries or millennia.

#### 5. Prophecy and Fate as Narrative Structure
Prophecies, viewings, dreams, and the Pattern itself provide a framework of
destiny that characters must navigate. The tension between fate and free will
is not abstract — it is experienced personally by characters who know what
they are prophesied to do and must choose how (or whether) to do it.

#### 6. Political Realism
Jordan (a veteran and student of history) built political systems that feel
real. Nations have competing interests. Alliances shift. Rulers make
decisions based on imperfect information. The Aes Sedai's internal politics
are as dangerous as any external threat. The Last Battle is nearly lost not
because the Shadow is overwhelming, but because human factionalism prevents
a unified response.

#### 7. Consequences and Continuity
Actions have lasting consequences. The cleansing of saidin changes the
political landscape. Rand's hardening leads to a crisis at Dragonmount.
The Seanchan invasion creates refugees, cultural clash, and permanent
change. Nothing is reset. The world at the end of the series is profoundly
different from the world at the beginning.

### Strengths for Worldbuilders to Study
- **Cultural specificity**: Give every people distinct clothing, food, speech,
  architecture, and values. These details make a world feel lived-in.
- **Systematic magic**: Define rules and stick to them. This creates
  opportunities for clever problem-solving and meaningful limitations.
- **Deep history with present consequences**: The past should shape the
  present in specific, traceable ways.
- **Multiple perspectives**: Show the same world through different cultural
  lenses. What is normal to one culture is horrifying to another (Seanchan
  damane, for instance).
- **Gender and power**: Consider how fundamental social categories shape
  every aspect of your world.
- **Political complexity**: Real politics involves competing interests, not
  just good vs. evil.
- **Earned revelations**: The Aiel's true history is devastating because it
  contradicts everything they believe about themselves. Build toward
  revelations that recontextualize what the reader thought they knew.

### Weaknesses and Limitations
- **Pacing**: The exhaustive detail that makes the worldbuilding rich can
  slow the narrative. Books 7-10 of the series are widely criticized for
  plot stagnation amid worldbuilding.
- **Repetitive Description**: Jordan describes certain cultural details
  (clothing, hairstyles, customs) so frequently that readers become
  frustrated. The worldbuilding can overwhelm the story.
- **Gender Essentialism**: While the gender-divided magic system is
  inventive, some readers find that the portrayal of gender relations
  relies on essentialist stereotypes — women and men are constantly
  frustrated by each other's supposedly inherent nature.
- **Limited Non-Human Diversity**: Unlike Tolkien, Jordan's world is almost
  entirely human. The Ogier are the only significant non-human race. This
  is a deliberate choice but limits certain kinds of worldbuilding.
- **Complexity Barrier**: The sheer volume of nations, cultures, characters,
  and history can be overwhelming for new readers. The worldbuilding is
  so dense that it requires an encyclopedia (literally — "The World of
  Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time" exists as a companion volume).

### Lessons for Worldbuilders
1. **Culture is worldbuilding.** The way people eat, dress, speak, and
   relate to each other IS the world. Do not neglect daily life in favor
   of cosmic lore.
2. **Rules create drama.** A magic system with clear limitations creates
   more interesting stories than one without limits. The tension comes
   from characters working within constraints.
3. **History is not backdrop.** Make history matter. Let past events drive
   present conflicts. Let characters discover history and have it change
   their understanding.
4. **Diversity within unity.** Even within a single world, cultures should
   differ radically. What one people considers virtue, another considers
   weakness.
5. **Every system has a cost.** The Three Oaths limit Aes Sedai. The taint
   limits male channelers. The a'dam enables and horrifies. The most
   interesting worldbuilding elements are double-edged.
6. **Let the world be discovered gradually.** Do not dump all information
   at once. Let readers learn the world as characters do, through
   experience and encounter.
7. **Be consistent, but not rigid.** Internal consistency makes a world
   believable. But leave room for mystery, surprise, and the unknown.
