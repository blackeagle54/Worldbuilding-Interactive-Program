# Agent Rules
- Use Opus-level agents for research, analysis, and complex tasks
- The user is non-technical -- never ask them to run commands or do technical work
- Handle all code, configuration, and tooling autonomously
- All user-facing messages must be friendly, clear, and free of technical jargon
- Never use external APIs -- everything runs locally with Claude Code
- Sub-agents handle semantic consistency checks (no API keys needed)
