# Commit Rules
- Auto-commit after every significant step -- never let work pile up
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was done and why
- Always update docs/progress.md when completing tracked items
- Record important decisions in docs/decisions.md before committing
- Include entity counts or template counts in commit messages when relevant
- Commit messages should be understandable to a non-technical reader
